**How to file GST through software?**
-------------------------------------

Filing out GST returns can be a complicated process if you fail to understand the nuances of it. So, in this segment, we discuss [how you can file your GST](https://giddh.com/gst/) using a billing software like Giddh. But before that, remember, as per the guidelines of GST, a taxpayer needs to furnish monthly returns and one annual return. The taxpayer needn’t file all types of return but must file returns based on the activities they undertake.

If you’re a regular taxpayer, you need to file these three returns:

- GSTR 1 (Statement of Outward Supplies) – It signifies the tax liability of the supplier for the supplies which got affected in the last month and must be filed out by the 10<sup>th</sup> of every month. Example: For an outward supply made in July, the tax will be filed by the 10<sup>th</sup> of August.

- GSTR 2 (Statement of Inward Supplies) – It signifies accrual of Input Tax Credit and is auto-populated from the GSTR – 1s filed by the corresponding supplier of the taxpayer. You can file this return by the 15<sup>th</sup> of every month.

- GSTR 3 – It’s a consolidated return that must be filed by the 20<sup>th</sup> of every month. It consolidates the following – Outward and Inward supplies, ITC availed, tax payable, and Tax paid (using cash and ITC).

- In case, you wish to file an Annual Return, you can file it by December 31, of the next FY simply by collating details of expense and income for the entire financial year. While your GSTR -2 is auto-populated from supplier’s GSTR – 1s, the GSTR – 3 is populated from your GSTR – 1 and GSTR – 2 only.
