In 2024, over 80% of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) report difficulty in managing tax compliance due to the complexity of GST, VAT, and international tax regulations.

Navigating the tax requirements of various regions can be an overwhelming task, but businesses must remain compliant to avoid costly penalties and audits. As the tax landscape becomes more complex, relying on outdated systems or manual processes is no longer an option for business owners and accountants.
