What Is Working Capital?
------------------------

Working capital is the money used to fund the day-to-day operations of a business. It’s used to pay short-term debts and cover other operational expenses.

**How to calculate working capital?**
-------------------------------------

Working capital is calculated as-

**Current assets (things you own that can be converted into cash) — Current liabilities (costs you will incur in the next 12 months).**

- Stocks or Bonds
- Cash in hand
- Cash in bank
- Short-term investments etc.

And here are some examples of items falling under the category of current liabilities:

- Creditors
- Outstanding Expenses
- Short-term debt etc.

**Importance of Working Capital**
---------------------------------

<img class="wp-block-image size-large" src = "https://miro.medium.com/max/660/1*RSNLRFxvrvv_9avxah6BUA.jpeg" />Working capital keeps the business operations moving. It is needed to purchase raw materials, to pay the workers and staff and also to pay the recurring expenses like electricity and power bills, rent, etc.

Having positive working capital can be a good sign of the short-term financial health for a company because it has enough liquid assets remaining to pay off short-term bills and to internally finance the growth of their business.

Negative working capital means assets aren’t being used effectively, and a company may a liquidity crisis. Even if a company has lots invested in fixed assets, it will face financial challenges if liabilities come due too soon.

And what happens when you run out of money to meet your day-to-day business needs? **Bankruptcy**!

A company that pays its creditors well on time has a positive reputation in the credit market. Such a goodwill helps a company to get raw materials on credit. It can also get loans and advances from the banks.

Hence, working capital increases a company’s creditworthiness.

What is the working capital cycle (WCC)?
----------------------------------------

Working capital cycle (WCC) is the time taken by any organization to convert its net current assets and current liabilities into cash. In layman’s terms, the working capital cycle is the duration between buying goods to manufacturing products and generating cash flow according to the selling of products.

Ideally, the WCC should be short since the shorter the working capital cycle, the faster the organization gets the cash stuck in working capital. If the WCC gets longer, the entire capital gets stuck in the operating cycle and the organization fails to earn significant returns. WCC helps you in monitoring the ability and the efficiency of the organization to manage its short-term liquidity position.

Three main steps of the working capital cycle are:

- Paying for the inventory/assets you plan to sell
- Sell out the inventory or provide services to a client
- Receive back payment from the goods sold

*i.e.,*

***Working Capital Cycle = Inventory Days + Receivable Days – Payable Days***

Features of Working Capital – A Quick Overview
----------------------------------------------

The primary goal of maintaining working capital is to ensure a streamlined operation of the organization. A decent flow of working capital allows the organizations to get operational flexibility and balance both liquidity and profitability.

Certain features of working capital that you must know includes:

### Short Term needs and Circular Movement

The conversion of working capital to cash to working capital is a recurrent process and goes on continuously.

### Permanency and Fluctuation

Working capital is an important necessity as it continues the production activity of the organization. So, till the time the production continues for the enterprise, they’ll require a decent flow of working capital. Another important aspect of working capital is that it fluctuates a lot and varies directly according to the level of production.

### **Less Risky**

Working capital is less risky as it’s dependent on product prices whose variations are less severe in general. Any form of technological change doesn’t impact it directly as it gets converted into cash again and again.

### **How to use working capital?**

Working capital is important for day-to-day operations, for funding your organizations’ growth and assisting and preparing you well in advance for any difficult times that lie ahead.

You must have sufficient working capital to purchase additional inventory in advance before the peak season begins, upgrade your store (if needed), and still have enough balance to give your employees the paycheck each month irrespective if it’s a peak season or not.

Decent working capital gives you the flexibility to market your products/services during tough times and continue with the cash flow without creating gaps in the net revenue for your organization. To better understand what amount of working capital you need for your organization, you must figure out the items which are increasing or decreasing the working capital.

At times, the businesses rely on credit lines available via banks to safeguard the organization from diluting and cease their operations due to a lack of capital. In such circumstances, the management keeps a close watch on the working capital.
