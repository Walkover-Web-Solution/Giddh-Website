## **Why Online Invoicing Software?**

Online invoice software is a potent tool that automates your recurring invoicing process. In addition, the software is a worthy choice for all businesses, as it ensures 100% accuracy, processes payments in minutes (entirely digitally), and manages your subscriptions. With such a software solution, you no longer have to waste precious time preparing invoices with estimates and quotes. Here’s a look at why you need to have online invoicing software.

### Simplifies the process and reduces costs for both you and your clients:

Giddh’s [online invoicing software in India](https://giddh.com/) is a brilliant solution that helps you automate invoicing tasks that you may have previously had to do manually. It also allows you to use your company’s logo when sending customised notifications and emails.

### **Payments can be made from anywhere, at any time:** 

The best part about this software solution is that it enables your clients to create a personalized payment dashboard, allowing them to track all their invoices and payments in one place. 

The software also allows your clients to make payments from anywhere, at any time, using multiple payment gateways. What’s more, your clients can even make their due payments through their smartphones. 

Giddh’s online invoice software from India can be accessed from cell phones, and clients can track their invoices and manage payments directly from anywhere – it truly can’t get simpler than this. No more will your payment be stuck for days or weeks on end because your client is off-site.

### **Invoices can be converted into PDF files:** 

With this online invoicing software, you and your clients will not have to rely on paper-based invoices. The software automatically generates an e-copy and helps you send the file by email as well. 

The tool even offers a print option, so you can print out the invoice and send it via courier or regular post if this is what your client prefers.

### **Follow-up reminders can be sent:** 

How often have you had to follow up with a client for a payment? Business owners usually need to follow up with clients for payments, which can be a tedious task. It involves tracking all the invoices you’ve sent but have yet to receive payment for. 

You’ll also need to send a reminder to each client manually. But with online invoicing software, you can send follow-up reminders directly through the automated settings on the cloud invoicing tool.

### **User-friendly and reliable:** 

Giddh’s India-based online invoice software is highly user-friendly. It means you don’t have to allocate additional resources to train your staff on how to use the platform. 

The easy-to-use automated invoice software is also very reliable. It keeps you and all your clients updated about the status of their invoices and payments, thus ensuring complete transparency to all parties involved. 

By leveraging online invoicing software, you and your internal teams can streamline the payment and invoicing process, allowing you to focus on core business activities and sales improvement.

### **Improves cash flow:** 

The primary purpose of your business is to provide services or products to your clients and receive payment for them. However, if you are struggling to raise invoices and get paid, your business's cash flow will likely suffer over time. 

Online invoicing software can be of immense help here since it helps you accelerate the entire invoicing process and bring in the payments due quickly. 

Additionally, enabling prompt follow-up with clients and facilitating easy payments from virtually anywhere can enhance overall cash flow and increase business profitability.

### **Invoices don’t get lost:** 

If you rely on traditional methods to send your invoice to your clients, there’s always a chance that the invoice may get lost. If this happens, you’ll need to create the invoice again and then repost it to your client. 

However, there is no guarantee that it will reach them safely. Even if your client receives your invoice, there’s still a chance they might miss it among all the paperwork they receive. 

[Online invoice software](https://giddh.com/blog/what-is-online-invoicing-software-a-guide-to-using-invoice-software-for-business-success-in-2020?page=1) eliminates such problems, and you’ll always have a digital copy of your invoice for reference even years after you raise the invoice.

### **A lot less paperwork:** 

As companies become greener and reduce their carbon footprint, it will undoubtedly [benefit your business](https://giddh.com/blog/benefits-of-invoice-automation-for-small-businesses?page=3) and society at large to avoid paperwork and opt for an online invoicing solution. 

The problem with traditional invoicing is that it can take up a lot of desk space, and there’s a high probability that necessary invoices may get misplaced. 

Online invoicing solves this problem by reducing the paperwork you have to deal with. You will also have easy and quick access to all your invoices whenever you need them.

## **Process of Online Invoicing**

An [online GST invoice software](https://giddh.com/blog/how-to-get-paid-faster-simple-tips-to-getting-paid-promptly?page=2) utilizes a built-in database to retrieve unbilled work items. The software can differentiate between unbilled items and invoices.

Once all the unbilled work is retrieved, the software will organize invoices for different clients and project all of this data on a single screen. This is customisable, allowing you to edit the various fields displayed, such as hours worked, bill rates, and descriptions. All in all, it will take you just a few minutes to review each invoice. Once you make all the changes required to the different invoices, the software will be ready to invoice the unbilled items.

Once you have created the invoice online, you can send it to your clients through the software, by email, or post it or courier it to them, based on the agreement you have with your client.

## **How to Generate an Invoice Online**

How do you generate invoices online? With an efficient online GST invoice software, you can create, manage, and track your invoices with ease. To generate an invoice online, you will need to follow the steps mentioned below:

* . Fill in your details and the details of your client in the invoice template.
