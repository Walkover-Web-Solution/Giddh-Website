In India, GST (Goods and Services Tax) compliance remains a critical challenge for businesses across various sectors. According to recent data from the GST Council, over **10 million** GST taxpayers are registered under the new system.

However, many still struggle with the complexities of [**GST tax calculation**](https://giddh.com/in/gst) and filing. With the constant changes to GST rates and laws, businesses often find themselves caught in a cycle of errors, penalties, and missed deadlines.

But how can you ensure your business remains compliant, accurate, and efficient with GST? The answer lies in the right accounting software.

In this blog, we’ll explore how the right GST-enabled accounting software can help automate GST tax calculation, streamline filings, and provide the audit trail you need for full compliance.

We’ll also discuss Giddh, a robust [online accounting tool](https://giddh.com/blog/features-every-online-accounting-software-must-have?page=5) that simplifies GST tax calculation and streamlines the filing process.

### **What is GST Tax Calculation?**

GST tax calculation is the process by which businesses determine the amount of Goods and Services Tax they owe or are eligible to claim back. The calculation structure varies based on the type of transaction and the location of the business. In India, GST is divided into three types:

- **CGST** (Central GST)

- **SGST** (State GST)

- **IGST** (Integrated GST)

**Basic formula for GST calculation:**

- **CGST \= (Taxable Value × GST Rate) ÷ 2**

- **SGST \= (Taxable Value × GST Rate) ÷ 2**

- **IGST \= Taxable Value × GST Rate**

This structure allows businesses to split the tax between the central and state governments, or, in the case of inter-state transactions, pay IGST, which is later divided between the Center and the state.

## Common Mistakes Businesses Make When Choosing GST Software

**Mistake 1: Choosing Basic GST Filing Software**  
Many businesses opt for [GST filing software](https://giddh.com/blog/gst-compliant-accounting-software-for-businesses) that only handles invoicing and filing, without focusing on the broader accounting needs. While filing is critical, companies require an integrated solution that handles GST tax calculations and provides a comprehensive audit trail.

Giddh is an example of accounting software that integrates GST tax calculation and filing, ensuring your business stays compliant without missing critical steps.

**Mistake 2: Not Considering Cloud-Based Solutions**  
Offline software can limit your business’s ability to scale. [Cloud-based accounting solutions](https://giddh.com/blog/benefits-of-cloud-based-accounting-software?page=2) offer several benefits, including remote access, real-time updates, and the ability to scale. These solutions ensure that your team can access the latest data and file returns from anywhere.

Giddh, as a cloud-based solution, provides businesses with flexibility and scalability, eliminating concerns about outdated software or data access issues.

**Mistake 3: Not Accounting for Growth**  
Businesses evolve, and so should your accounting tools. It’s crucial to select software that can scale with your business. A small business may begin with basic features, but as your company grows, the software should accommodate advanced features, multi-user access, and multi-currency support.

Giddh grows with your business, offering unlimited user access, multi-currency support, and the flexibility to manage multiple companies under a single account.
