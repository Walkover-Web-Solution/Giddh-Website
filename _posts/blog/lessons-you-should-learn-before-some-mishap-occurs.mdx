> Exact is the case with accountants. They will keep deserting an issue till they believe that it can be managed on its own. And then, same thing happens as expected — occurrence of mishaps.

So it’s better if some lessons are learned in advance before something business influencing takes place. Some of the basic lessons to learn are:

**1. Go tech-savvy**

This has got to be one of the most initial things to do if you are talking about managing your accounts. Because papers-in-bulk and today’s-trendy-accountant do not match anymore.

**2. Do not just MAINTAIN records, MANAGE them**

Another thing you got to be doing is managing your books of records. Because most of the accountants focus only on maintaining the accounts, and forget managing them in the entire process.

**3. The best way to learn from your mistakes is to stop repeating them**

In order to learn from your mistakes, you need to assure first that you will not be repeating them in the future.

**4. Try to have the eyes of a seer**

Not repeating your mistakes is just not enough as long as you do not have the eyes of a seer which can foresee the mistakes that might take place in future.

**5. NEVER keep things in queue**

The only good way of managing accounts is NOT to keep anything pending or in queue. That way, errors would be corrected as soon as they come up.

Well, the above said was enough to save you from committing errors, we suppose.

We would not like to stuff the accountants with what to do and what not to do list this time. All we want to say to our ardent accountants is **Happy Holi!**
