Being able to do so *faster,* is priceless.

Your offline accounting software might be filled with several features but they are hard to find, and in your hour of need, it fails you miserably. The new search feature in Giddh, your favourite [cloud accounting software](https://giddh.com) not only makes things faster, but its also easier to use and more reliable.

So here are 2 awesome ways the new search in Giddh is exactly what you’ve been looking for.

1. **We have KISS(Kept It Simple, Stupid!)**

Gone are the days when you had to use a software for weeks to finally get acquainted with the options that were decked under plain, old school, complicated control panels.

Now, using the Giddh Search, with just the magic of typing Giddh’s very own magic spell- *ctrl+k(windows)/cmd+k(macOS),* you can summon the **search box** where you can type the initials of the page where you want to land on and hit *enter*!

So now you know that while we’ve made Giddh more practical and sophisticated, we’ve made sure it hasn’t come at the cost of simplicity.

**2. Just What You Want- Nothing More, Nothing Less!**

Often, when you are searching for a feature that comes under a subgroup of a different major feature, you’re looking at a ton of irrelevant listing, and that could get really frustrating when you’re trying to find something important.

You might think of it as going through your wardrobe and getting first confused — and — annoyed later, by the heaps of unnecessary clothes in front of you.

And thus, we put in great deal of efforts to understand what users search for, and *how* they find what they’re looking for.

This drive made us create the search *smarter* so it can auto-suggest the relevant features or options, making sure you use the most effective means to find what you’re looking for.

For example, with *Invoice* selected, search suggests three potential filters-*Generate, Settings, Templates* before you even type anything further.

Now, THAT’S intuitive!

**….And that’s how we do it**
