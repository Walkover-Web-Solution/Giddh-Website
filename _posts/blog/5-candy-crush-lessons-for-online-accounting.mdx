<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large">![](https://miro.medium.com/max/240/1*O1UqZr888pJTpMlBOt_scg.png)</figure></div>Candy Crush has been one of the most played games in the world. It earns $12,71,162 in estimated daily revenue and gets 65672 daily downloads on an average. On buses, local trains, cafes, waiting in line (waiting anywhere, in fact!) one can see people with their phones or tablets play this highly addictive game and can hear its telltale theme.

The game’s popularity also yielded a number of posts often titled “Life Lessons Learned from Candy Crush”. Clearly, smart &amp; successful people from all walks of life reduce stress and unwind with this game and can learn a thing or two as well. Which got the folks at Giddh wondering, what takeaways from Candy Crush can help you work with your online accounting for greater business success? Here are 5 takeaways, we came up with.

**1. Reaching Out for help to Level Up.**

Part of the charm of Candy Crush is the sense of community it creates. You can help your friends by gifting them with lives or extra moves, and can also receive help from others. But there’s a catch. You can only receive help from those who are on the same level as you, or above it. And, while lives and extra moves are at times handed out for no reason, when you need to advance to the next board, you have to ask for them.

In accounting, we’re always better off seeking the help and using it from those who are doing better than we are, at least in that particular area. If you’re looking for accounting help, you’ll be right to turn to a professional [online accounting service](https://giddh.com/) fully equipped with features such as inventory management, automatic invoice generation etc.

**2. Being Patient Pays off.**

The key to many candy crush levels is breaking combinations of special candies. But to create not just special candies and to create those special candies next to one another, it requires patience. You have to wait for the right time to make your move.

Similarly, in conducting business, timing is everything. If you make one move too soon, you could lose a great opportunity later on. An online accounting software that is equipped with features like dashboard, and audit log can help you analyse your own company’s financial state to help you make the right move at the right time.

**3. Diffusing the ‘Ticking Time Bomb’.**

Waiting for optimal conditions to make a move is often sound business advice, but other times, you have to take an opportunity when you see it, even if conditions aren’t optimal. You also have to be aware of every single financial activity and its consequences to your business. This is especially true in Candy Crush levels after the 100s, when a ‘candy bomb’ timer reaches zero, it will explode the whole board and you will lose the level, and have to try the level again.

An online software with real time updates can help you see if there’s a “ticking time bomb” situation in your bookkeeping as soon as it arises and you have the tools and ability to defuse it before it hampers your business and you can focus on growth.

**4. Being Top Can Expand Your Resources.**

When you reach the Candy Crush leaderboard with a score in the Top 3 amongst your peers, your name appears at the bottom of the screen, and friends have the opportunity to give you gifts or lives.

In accounting, you simply have more choices when you’re the most decisive and make the crucial decision to jump on cloud based accounting software. You’ll have better features to make use of in your accounting, better understanding of your profit and losses to work with, and ultimately make growth to get more connections in business. This will help you in achieving your milestones in the most efficient of ways.

**5. Evaluating all options could reveal a smarter move.**

We already mentioned how important patience is in candy crush — and in business. But have you ever been in a business situation where you initially thought you saw a great opportunity, until further evaluation and analysis revealed a better option? Often, those “better options” are hidden with your financial accounting statements. A virtual accounting software can help you spot those smart moves and take the right action at the right time.

Whether you are learning from others, reading books or playing a game, continuous learning and jumping on board with the newest technology is mandatory for business owners who are looking to excel and flourish.
