![All You Need to Know About GST Invoice](/img/blog/invoices-you-need-to-know-for-gst/all_you_need_to_know_about_gst_invoice.png) 


GST invoicing is **no longer optional; it's foundational.** With compliance rules tightening in 2025, **every business** issuing taxable supplies must follow the updated **GST billing rules** to avoid penalties, input credit loss, or audit triggers.

In this blog, we break down the **types of GST invoices**, when to issue them (for both goods and services), and how tools like [**Giddh GST invoice software**](https://giddh.com/in/gst) can help you stay compliant and profitable.

## **What is a GST Invoice?**

A **GST invoice** is a tax-compliant document issued by a registered seller to the buyer. It includes all necessary details, such as GSTIN, HSN codes, taxable value, applicable tax rates (CGST/SGST/IGST), and the total invoice value.

Think of it as the **cornerstone of your [GST compliance](https://giddh.com/blog/gst-compliant-accounting-software-for-businesses)**—the point from which **filings, credits, and refunds** all stem. If this is mismanaged, the **snowball effect** can trigger cascading issues, from return rejections to blocked ITC and vendor disputes.

## **Types of Invoices in GST You Must Know (2025 Edition)**

Every business must issue specific types of invoices depending on the nature of the supply. Here’s a breakdown:

![types of gst invoice](/img/blog/invoices-you-need-to-know-for-gst/types_of_invoices_in_gst.png) 

### **✅ 1\. Tax Invoice**

* **When Used**: For all **taxable supplies of goods or services**

* **Includes**: Tax breakdown, buyer/seller details, GSTIN, HSN/SAC, quantity, rate, etc.

### **✅ 2\. Bill of Supply**

* **When Used**: For **exempted goods/services** or **composite scheme suppliers**

* **Note**: Does **not include tax** details.

### **✅ 3\. Supplementary Invoice**

* **When Used**: To rectify undercharged tax or price revisions post-supply.

### **✅ 4\. Debit Note / Credit Note**

* **When Used**: To adjust previously issued invoices (increase/decrease in value).

**Pro Tip**: You must report all these in **GSTR-1** filings accurately to avoid mismatches in your buyer’s input credit claims.

## **When to Issue a GST Invoice (Goods vs. Services)**

To comply with GST rules, it’s not enough to *just* issue the invoice. You must do so **at the right time**. Here's a simplified view:

  <table className="w-full border border-gray-300 border-collapse text-sm leading-relaxed">
    <thead>
      <tr className="bg-gray-50">

        <td className="border border-gray-300 px-3 py-3">

      <tr>

          Recipient issues invoice on goods receipt
        </td>
        <td className="border border-gray-300 px-3 py-3">
          Issue before completion or to the extent of service received
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td className="border border-gray-300 px-3 py-3 font-medium">
          Approval-Based
        </td>
        <td className="border border-gray-300 px-3 py-3">
          When approval converts to sale
        </td>
        <td className="border border-gray-300 px-3 py-3">
