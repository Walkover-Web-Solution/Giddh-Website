If you’re managing your GST returns manually, you’re probably familiar with the stress of missing deadlines, dealing with complex returns, and trying to avoid penalties. In fact, according to a survey, most [SMEs still handle their GST filing](https://giddh.com/blog/gst-and-its-impacts-on-indian-smes-working-capital?page=2) manually, exposing themselves to delays, errors, and costly mistakes.

As businesses grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with GST compliance, especially when tax laws and filing requirements grow. The good news is that [GST-compliant accounting software](https://giddh.com/in/gst) can help you automate the entire process, saving you time and reducing the risk of costly errors.

Let’s dive more in-depth into the true cost of manual filing and how automating GST returns can simplify your workflow.

## What is the Real Cost of Manual GST Filing?

Managing GST filing manually can seem like a manageable task in the beginning, but as your business grows, the process becomes time-consuming and prone to errors. Here's a breakdown of why continuing to manage your GST filings manually is a bad investment in the long run:

#### **1\. Time-Consuming Data Entry**

Manual GST filing involves a lot of data entry: updating invoices, verifying tax calculations, and entering all the details into the GST portal. This takes hours every month, time that could be better spent on growing your business or focusing on core operations.

For instance, every time you make a sale or purchase, you’ll need to manually track these transactions and ensure that GST is applied accurately. The result? A lot of time is wasted on repetitive tasks.

#### **2\. Risk of Human Error and Penalties**

The most significant risk of manual GST filing is human error. A misplaced decimal, missed invoice, or incorrect tax rate can lead to mistakes that have a financial impact. According to a report, about 50% of businesses that manage their GST manually incur fines or penalties due to errors. It only takes one mistake to trigger an audit or incur significant penalties.

For example, a simple error like failing to apply the correct GST rate for certain products could lead to an incorrect filing, triggering fines and extra paperwork. With manual systems, these errors are more common—and much more costly.

#### **3\. Difficulty Managing GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, GSTR-9, and Other Returns**

As a small business, you’ll need to file multiple GST returns: GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, and GSTR-9. Each has its own set of requirements and complexities, especially when dealing with various types of goods and services. Trying to manually track, calculate, and report all the information for each return without software can feel like navigating a maze.

- **GSTR-1** is about reporting sales.
- **GSTR-3B** is a summary return that requires both sales and purchases.
- **GSTR-9** is the annual return, which consolidates all filings throughout the year.

Manually managing these forms without a system is complex and error-prone, making it easy to miss deadlines or file inaccurate returns.

## 4 Signs Your Business Needs to Automate GST Filing

![GST Filing Automation](/img/blog/gst-compliant-accounting-software-for-businesses/gst_filing_automation.jpg)

If any of the following sounds familiar, it’s a clear sign your business should automate its GST filing:

#### **1\. You Miss Due Dates or Get Penalty Notices**

Missing GST filing deadlines can result in heavy penalties, and frequent mistakes could prompt audits. Automation ensures you never miss a deadline or forget a filing again.

#### **2\. Your Accountant Relies on Spreadsheets**

While spreadsheets are helpful, they’re prone to human errors. If your accountant is using spreadsheets to track GST returns, there’s a higher likelihood of mistakes. Automation significantly reduces these risks by pulling the necessary data from your accounts directly.

#### **3\. You’re Unsure of ITC Eligibility**

Input Tax Credit (ITC) is a mechanism that allows businesses to offset the GST paid on purchases against the GST collected on sales. Manual tracking of ITC eligibility can be tedious and prone to oversight, leading to missed opportunities for tax savings.

#### **4\. You’re Overwhelmed During GSTR-9 Filing**

Filing GSTR-9 can be especially overwhelming for small businesses, as it involves consolidating all your GST filings for the year. If this process stresses you out each year, it’s a clear indicator that it’s time to switch to a more efficient, automated system.

## What is GST Compliant Accounting Software? A Simplified Explanation

So, what exactly is GST-compliant accounting software, and why does it matter?

GST-compliant accounting software is specifically designed to ensure that businesses comply with all GST regulations while automating critical accounting functions. Unlike generic accounting software, which may not be updated regularly with changing tax laws, [GST-compliant software](https://giddh.com/blog/gst-and-its-impacts-on-indian-smes-working-capital?page=2) automatically adjusts to ensure that your business remains compliant.

### Key Features of GST-Compliant Accounting Software

Here are the standout features that make GST-compliant accounting software essential for small businesses:

#### **1\. Automated GST Return Filing (GSTR-1, GSTR-3B)**

Automating returns like GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B allows you to easily generate and submit returns directly from your software. All necessary data is pulled from your accounting records, reducing the time spent on manual entry and ensuring accuracy.

#### **2\. Real-Time ITC Reconciliation**

The software helps you ensure that your Input Tax Credit (ITC) claims are valid. Real-time reconciliation with the GST Network (GSTN) ensures you can claim the maximum ITC available without the risk of errors.

#### **3\. Smart Data Validation (e.g., GSTN Validation)**

GST-compliant software validates your invoices and transactions against the GST Network to ensure all details are correct before filing. This reduces the chances of discrepancies and helps to avoid errors.

#### **4\. Compliance with Local Regulations**

Aside from meeting GST requirements, the software also complies with local tax regulations, ensuring that you’re always up to date with the latest legal standards.

### Why It’s a Must for Small Businesses

Adopting GST-compliant [accounting software](https://giddh.com/blog/benefits-of-online-accounting-to-small-business?page=6) is no longer optional for growing businesses. Not only does it streamline your operations and reduce errors, but it also helps your firm avoid the financial risks associated with manual GST filing. It allows you to focus on growth while staying compliant.

Look for software that automatically generates all the required GST returns. Whether it’s GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, or GSTR-9, the software should pre-fill these forms, saving you valuable time.

#### **2\. ITC Reconciliation**

Automated ITC reconciliation helps track eligible input tax credits and avoid errors during the filing process.

#### **3\. Invoice Validation with GSTN**

Ensure your software validates invoices with the GST Network to ensure every sale and purchase is accurately recorded and compliant with GST laws.

Choose software that offers real-time error checking to highlight discrepancies before submission, reducing the chances of penalties or re-filing.

#### **5\. Multi-User Support and Role-Based Access**
