I am very excited to provide you this information, we have finally launched Giddh 0.1.0 after 18 months of hard work of all the team members. This is the very beginning and we are mainly focussed on Security instead of features. So probably you will get less features for now. But we are working very hard to give you only the best and relevant features.

Below you can find our first features in action.

- Login with Linked-in, Google and Twitter.
- Create, update and edit basic information of a Company.
- Manage Groups and accounts.
- Permission to share Company as well as Group and Account.
- [Bulk SMS](https://msg91.com/) and [Email ](https://sendgrid.com/)for providing any bulk information.
- Do entries via ledger.
- Basic Reporting via Trial balance, Balance sheet, profit and Loss.
- Supporting Multiple financial years.
- Advance search.
- Ledger features: Import, Export, Magic link, Send Ledger and search.
- Historical reporting via historical comparison between Debit balance, Credit balance, Opening balance and Closing balance, historical profit and historical Net worth.

Here we are also coming with RESTful API for developers. With the help of this any software can make direct entries without the human effort to make their Accounting [Books](https://giddh.com/) functional.
