A man started his business two years ago and has performed well so far. However, for accounting, he maintains an Excel spreadsheet in which he records transactions, such as the amount to be recovered from customers and the amount due to suppliers.

He now wants to expand his business and avail himself of credit from the bank. Still, to his horror, the bank has refused his request since his expenses were not adequately recorded, and no accounting records are available to him.

To make things worse, he is penalized by the Tax department for not being tax-compliant due to the lack of a proper accounting system.

Although this is a hypothetical situation, several small and medium-sized business entrepreneurs often neglect their overall accounting, which has a direct adverse effect on their businesses.

Every small business owner wants to save money, and they want to maximize their profits, too, and this is where the [best online accounting software](https://giddh.com/in) will help you out and meet your needs as well.

### **4\. Easy and Direct Tax Compliance**

The Indian tax system's complexity poses a challenge for business owners to stay compliant on time, every time.

### **5\. Collaboration and Analysis Made Easy**

There are several key [financial reports](https://giddh.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-business-financial-reporting?page=2), such as the trial balance, profit & loss statements, and balance sheet, that the business owner requires on a timely basis for analysis of their business.

**Track Payables and Receivables**

- Easily monitor money owed to others (payables).

- Gain a clear view of cash flow and financial health.

However, all this information would be of little use to a business owner if it’s not easy to analyze or comprehend.
