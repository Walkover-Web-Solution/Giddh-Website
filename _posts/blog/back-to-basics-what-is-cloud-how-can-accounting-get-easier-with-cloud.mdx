By working in the cloud, you can have easy access to financial information and capacity to work in tandem with your team.

Use of ordinary accounting software which is not in cloud can be a tedious task. Typically, it can take up too much of your valuable time and effort. Instead of dealing with the core of your business, you waste time dealing with manually working on the numbers. But a cloud software can save money and time of your company.

**What Is Cloud?**

Cloud computing is just like net banking. Every time you use online finances, you are using the cloud. In fact, the cloud is a platform to make software and data accessible online anywhere, anytime, and from any device. No longer are you dependent only on your personal hard drive.

**Issues with Traditional Accounting Software**

- Neither the software nor the data gets updated on real time
- The software works only on one computer and data frisks from one place to another, like on a USB drive. This is not reliable or secure.
- User access is only for one person. Other important persons cannot access details of customers or finances.
- It is complicated and costly to maintain back-ups of information.
- It is time-consuming, difficult and expensive to upgrade software.
- Customer support is slow and expensive.

**How is Cloud Useful for Accounting?**

You can make use of cloud-based software from any device using an internet connection. Online accounting enables business owners linked to their accountants and financial data. The software can integrate with a complete system of add-ons. It is easy to use, cost-effective, and scalable.

In case of cloud, there is no need to install and run applications over a desktop computer. In its place, you only have to pay a monthly subscription for the online software.

Here are some benefits of best cloud accounting software:

**Tying up a distributed workforce**

Because accounting information is stored in the cloud, it can be accessed or updated from anywhere. Team members can collaborate with each other, even when based in various physical locations. This is useful when a manager needs to check on an invoice or sales rep wants to add receipts to the data base.

**Centralized data**

You will have only a single data file. In traditional accounting software, there was a need for multiple data files but in case of cloud, there is a centralized data base.

**Secure and easy sharing**

Cloud software enables sharing of data with all stakeholders from your accountant to your bank manager. No more do you need to send separate e-mails or exchange USB sticks to transmit data in an easy and safe manner.

**Automatic back-up**

Never will you have to create back-ups for files containing crucial data. This was a need in the past when very often multiple files were prone to getting lost.

**Work both offline and online**

One can enjoy the advantages of centralized data in an online mode. Better still, you can even work with data in offline mode as your data will sync automatically the next time you link to the internet. This is a great bonus when faced with internet outage.

Entrepreneurs and business owners are breathing a rare air today as they no longer need to live through the hassle of manually managing their books. They have moved away from the world of pen and paper and have stepped into the digital world of zeros and ones for their accounting needs.
