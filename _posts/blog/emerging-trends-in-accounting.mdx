**Emerging Issues in Accounting – A Quick Analysis**
----------------------------------------------------

Before we discuss the accounting trends, it’s important to look at two primary issues that the accounting industry is being plagued with.

### Traditional accounting roles are being taken over by AI

Artificial intelligence technology is expanding to virtually every industry that’s out there including the accounting industry as well. Looking at the [**recent trends in accounting**](https://giddh.com/blog/top-trends-in-accounting-industry-in-2020/), AI is becoming more proficient day by day at handling complexes accounting tasks like compiling the collected transactions into financial statements and tax returns. According to an estimate by Gartner, automating such accounting tasks through AI and robotic processes will save up to 25,000 hours of time invested in rework per year, which could then be used for other important tasks like forecasting, analysis, increasing engagement, and reducing the staff turnover.

The new accounting trends of automation and AI can ease up your work by taking care of the tedious and hefty tasks. However, one needs to be aware of whether AI will completely take over their duties and jobs. The solution for this emerging issue in accounting is professionals should try to get into an advisory or management role. They can take the responsibility of helping businesses adapt and implement AI and other emerging trends in accounting as they turn out to be more powerful and sophisticated. Moreover, automated repetitive tasks like payroll and tax form preparation will have to be cross-checked by humans which seems like a new opportunity for growth instead of a challenge.

Accounting professionals need to see new trends in accounting as a way to do their jobs more efficiently. Tapping into these trends can save a lot of their time which can be used for focusing on strategic tasks, such as financial planning and risk management.

### **Diversifying their skills to offer strategic advice is a challenge, but necessary**

Technology will surely eliminate the need for traditional accounting tasks and rules-based accounting skills, but among these emerging issues in financial accounting, the demand for people who can carry out an excellent financial analysis and strategy is also increasing. It does take time and effort to learn about financial forecasting and risk analysis or leveraging analytics tools to extract useful insights. So, one can’t just get out of bed one day and become the perfect financial advisor to their clients.

They have to put continuous efforts to make themselves familiar with the advanced forecasting and analytics features that their accounting software offers. Eventually, they will be better equipped to interpret the deep data and translate it into actionable advice. To get in sync with the emerging trends in business finance and start providing strategic advice to clients, it is recommended for accountants to talk to their clients, conduct surveys, and dig into the numbers to find out where they are struggling with their business goals and how to help them get there.

### **Cybersecurity**

With the **emerging trends in finance**, the challenge to keep security threats at bay is getting tougher. Hackers are targeting accounting information like credit cards, bank account numbers because of their high value. Therefore, as an accounting professional/ business leader, your responsibility goes beyond protecting your company’s data only. You also have to ensure that you are keeping security breaches away for all the contacts in your system that include your employees, clients, and service providers. To be able to do that, you have to –

Keep your accounting software updated at all times. The updates come with new features according to [accounting software](https://giddh.com/) trends as well as patch security vulnerabilities.

- ***Client Retention is a Concern***

*The involvement of cloud accounting software is an emerging issue in financial accounting since it’s making it possible for the organizations to stack their information in an orderly fashion allowing accountants to run the last final check. It will further make the e-filing process quick and allow clients to send in their information in a few clicks. Owing to this digitization, the accountants will have to adapt to the changing landscape to meet up the client requirements and carry out their daily tasks.*

**Outsourcing accounting responsibilities:**

**Social media can be a source of clients and new talent:**

The accounting industry is witnessing many **emerging dimensions in accounting**, which includes software, technology, and billing. Billing is a traditional process, and it may be used on an hourly basis, which is mostly fixed.

This pricing model is upfront, and it creates a trustworthy bond between the client and consultant; which also means that the client gets their price certainty beforehand. This rewards the accountant, not only for hours spend but also for the effort and productivity that they ring to their clients.

With the business trend like cloud accounting, the possibilities are endless for small business owners and accountants who want to achieve the most of their potential. You too can reap the benefits of this revolutionary technology today and[ jump on the cloud today](https://giddh.com/).
