Businesses in the IT sector or IT-enabled services are often more tech-savvy (they better be). Owners are most likely to come from an engineering or other technical background, not necessarily, of course, but all this to say that they view accounting as a hassle. Now this is ironic because if they are so tech-savvy, they should be fully aware of the presence of online accounting software that has made bookkeeping a manageable yet more efficient exercise.
