### **What is GST and Why It’s Important for Your Business?**

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a unified indirect tax system introduced in India in 2017 to streamline taxation. It replaced multiple taxes, such as VAT, service tax, and excise duty. GST is levied on the supply of goods and services, ensuring a seamless flow of credits across the production chain. For businesses, understanding GST is essential not just for compliance, but also for effective tax planning and reporting.

#### **Why Tracking GST Rates is Critical for Your Business**

With frequent updates and a vast array of product categories, the [GST-compliant system](https://giddh.com/blog/gst-compliance-software-prepare-for-scrutiny) demands businesses stay on top of rate changes. A simple mistake in applying the wrong rate can lead to accounting errors and possible penalties. For business owners and accountants, knowing the correct GST rate for every product category is crucial for maintaining accurate financial records, filing tax returns, and avoiding compliance issues.
