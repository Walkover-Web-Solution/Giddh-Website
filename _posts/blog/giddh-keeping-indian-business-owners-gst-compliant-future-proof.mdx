It therefore also comes as no surprise that Indians on average spend 241 hours per year on tax preparation and filing ([World Bank Survey, 2016](http://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2015/11/11/doing-business-2016-report))

But with a little planning, diligent organising — and the use of a robust [online accounting system](https://giddh.com) — keeping your business compliant and ever ready to the new taxation landscape can be as easy as snap of fingers.
