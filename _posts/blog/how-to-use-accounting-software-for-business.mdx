## How To Choose The Best Accounting Software?

If you run a business, you need to understand the Importance of Accounting Software to track and record your income and expenses accurately. Ideally, this is the first software you should consider purchasing for your business; however, many business owners postpone getting the software unless they need to apply for a loan or pay their taxes.

When you are planning to get accounting software for your [business requirements](https://giddh.com/blog/turn-data-into-information?page=1), you will be flooded with several options to choose from, and that could be confusing. However, you can easily filter out what you want if you are clear about the criteria that must be taken into consideration before investing in an accounting system. 

Here are some essential criteria to help you decide which software will be the best fit for your business.

### **Online or Offline**

The first thing that you need to decide is whether you need an online software or an offline one for your desktop systems. Today, almost all businesses prefer [cloud-based software](https://giddh.com/cloud-accounting-software) because of the advantages it offers over traditional offline software. 

Desktop-based offline software may be used in some companies, such as retail stores, where internet connectivity isn’t always necessary. They can get their work done just fine with offline POS systems.

### Some of the advantages that cloud accounting software has over offline systems are:

* You can just sign up for the cloud services and start recording your transactions right away.  
* All upgrades and changes are implemented automatically without affecting your data.  
* You get the flexibility of accessing your records from anywhere and at any time.  
* You don’t have to worry about backup or maintenance as your service providers will take care of that.  
* Collaboration between different departments within an organization becomes easier.

### **Data Security**

If you plan to use online accounting software for small businesses, the data security feature is the most critical factor to consider.

**Inquire About Data Storage**: Ask how your service provider stores application data.

**Check Hosting Providers**: Many use Amazon, Rackspace, or their servers.

**Ensure Security Measures**: Confirm the provider’s security protocols to protect your data.

### **User Interface & Complexity**

Most business owners don’t come from an accounting background. Even if a dedicated accountant uses the accounting software, it must offer an easy-to-use interface so that business owners can log in to the system and gain an overview of their financial statements and records. 

**Avoid Complexity**: Opt for software with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.

**Minimize Training**: Simplify employee training to save time and cost.

**Focus on Essentials**: Choose software that doesn't include unnecessary features.

### **Scalability**

Business owners typically select an accounting system based on their current needs. As their business starts to grow, the software fails to match the requirements, and they are forced to migrate to new software. The process of completely switching to a new software from your existing system can be highly challenging. 

**Choose Scalable Software**: Ensure the software grows with your business.

**Start Small, Scale Up**: Begin with an entry-level version, then upgrade as needed.

**Giddh for Growth**: Giddh adapts to your business’s evolving needs.

### **Hidden Costs**

Sometimes, an [accounting software](https://giddh.com/blog/why-using-the-best-accounting-software-is-essential-for-organizations?page=5) provider may offer a basic version of the software at a low cost and then charge extra for additional features and maintenance costs. It is always better to know about these costs before buying the software. 

**Check for Hidden Costs**: Verify if there are additional charges for features.

**Review Pricing Pages**: Visit the provider’s site for details on basic and premium costs.

**Understand Additional Fees**: Look for pricing on extra services or features.

### **After-sales Support**

After-sales support is a crucial feature of your accounting software, yet many businesses tend to overlook it. It doesn’t matter how easy-to-use or good your software is; you will need support at some point. If you encounter an issue with a part of the software and support is not readily available, your investment will be futile. 

**Avoid Low-Cost, Low-Support Software**: Some inexpensive options often compromise support services.

**Verify Support Quality**: Ensure the software offers reliable customer support.

**Don't Skip Support Costs**: Consider Support Quality When Making a Purchase.
