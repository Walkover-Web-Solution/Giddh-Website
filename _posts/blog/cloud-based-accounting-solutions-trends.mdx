Occasionally, we witness changes occurring in the global business environment. And thus, staying current with such rapid changes is a tricky proposition.

In present times, innovations and technology have become an essential part of the accounting and bookkeeping industry.

Recent trends in accounting have surpassed outdated methods of financial management, which were hindered by the lack of real-time data and basic desktop-based software.

### 1\. Cloud Computing

One cloud-based [accounting solutions trend](https://giddh.com/blog/how-to-use-accounting-software-for-business) that shows no signs of slowing down is cloud computing technology. According to a study by North Bridge (a venture capital firm), nearly 75% of IT managers and senior executives reported using at least one cloud-based business application.

What is attractive about the cloud, you ask? A cloud approach is a powerful choice for companies seeking to outsource software and hardware support for minimising costs and focusing on core competencies. Web-based options also permit a simple extension of system access to branch offices and remotely active users.

This facility, which provides direct access to systems via a web browser and consistent internet connectivity, is a key benefit, enabling users to access business systems and data from anywhere, at any time.

Lastly, the subscription pricing model is desirable for companies seeking to spread software costs over time and avoid larger upfront investments.

[Cloud-based technology](https://giddh.com/cloud-accounting-software) is expected to gain stronger momentum in accounting trends in the current scenario, impacting various areas of business now and in the future. With the advantages of shared resources, server-run accounting software models, and easily accessible financial information through the cloud, accounting processes will be more efficient.

### 2\. Complete Functionality

A study of modern accounting software reveals that it typically includes many applications and modules that go beyond the conventional definition of accounting software.’ The current accounting software is likely to include functionalities that support manufacturing, inventory management, sales, and other business domains.

Single systems also provide a consistent data set, such that changes in one system are reflected in other systems in real-time. Apart from reducing repetition of work, a single data record can help enhance transparency and eliminate bottlenecks across multiple departments.

### 3\. Online Support for Implementation

[Accounting software](https://giddh.com/blog/how-to-use-accounting-software-for-business), by nature, can be complicated. Thanks to this complexity, users may sometimes require additional assistance from technical specialists for proper configuration, installation, and support.

However, with the luxury of widespread broadband connectivity, a user is no longer restricted to a specific geographical location to seek assistance. This access to online support implies that the users have the option to choose from a variety of support options.

### 4\. Mobile Accounting

The remotely located workforce is now a common occurrence in many enterprises. Having mobile accounting applications can be helpful to ensure that team members can complete tasks on the go.

Mobile accountancy is necessary because automated documentation is gradually replacing paper-based invoices and payment receipts, and is being widely accepted as well.

Therefore, incorporating automated mobile technology into your accounting processes can be a win-win situation for both your valued clients and your team members.

### 5\. Analytics and Reporting

There is nothing new about desiring to use data for guiding strategic decision-making. But the marked emphasis on business intelligence tools in accounting software is a new trend.

One can measure the impact of business analytics tools on a business's performance. The integration of analytical tools in [accounting software](https://giddh.com/) can help users create future strategies for addressing specific issues, such as identifying areas where to invest. These pinpointing expenses are higher than anticipated, and we need to devise ways to curb them.

Moreover, enterprises are looking for features that could generate [financial reports](https://giddh.com/financial-reporting), such as balance sheets, cash flow statements, profit and loss reports, etc, in a professional and presentable manner. Ultimately, this data is essential for making informed financial and management decisions.

With these new trends making their way into bookkeeping, accounting has undoubtedly entered its golden age.
