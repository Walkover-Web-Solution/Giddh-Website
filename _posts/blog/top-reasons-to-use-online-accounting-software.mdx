However, there are few highlight reasons to use Online Accounting software. These reasons do not only explain the importance of cloud computing, but also state why a business is incomplete without it.

The top six reasons include:

**1. Helps you achieve economies of scale**

Unlike the desktop accounting software’s which require every time installation and up gradation; online accounting software proffers many features like automatic updating and other major benefits, which ultimately helps in achieving economies of scale.

It can be only with the assistance of online accounting software that flexibility can be ensured in the business. You no longer require sitting at a fixed place to manage your accounts. Since everything is online, all you need is a computer and internet access, and you can proceed with accounts management anytime, anywhere.

**3. Pay as per usage**

One of the major advantages associated with cloud computing is that you pay only as per your usage — nothing less, nothing more. There is no hidden cost and you can stop paying when your work associated with the software is over.

**4. Much secure and organized**

Your data is much secure and organized with online accounting software when compared to normal desktop accounting software’s which run the risk of data loss and data theft.

**5. Enhanced productivity**

Less input and more output is what productivity is all about. And it can be achieved at ease by making use of cloud computing and producing quick results related to data processing, transaction handling, keeping yourself up-to-date with the accounting information, and so on.

**6. Usability by non-accountants**

Online accounting software can be used by anyone, be it amateur, layman or any other person belonging to the non-accounting background. What more can be asked? The reasons speak enough for the software and state why it is best for an individual as well as business concern.
