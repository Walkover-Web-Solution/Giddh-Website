 A business does transactions in large amounts. But it is very important for any business to understand the amount of data it needs to keep, and the kind of accounting report that needs to be generated. Giddh helps its users in doing just the same. It is online accounting software that helps you in managing your accounting activities day in, day out. It understands your business needs thereby substantiating that accounting is much more than garbage in and garbage out. One more thing, you are going to *love* the interface.
