#### Analysis has never been easier, more productive and immensely profitable with the Giddh Dashboard and its business reporting tools!

<img class="wp-block-image size-large" src = "https://miro.medium.com/max/1728/1*3kp8Ds5rYFol1_XrICLy4Q.png"/>Every growing business reaches a point where the “old way” of financial reporting and its analysis just stops delivering the way it used to. This usually happens when your business — and the data it generates — becomes more &amp; more complex and harder to comprehend. It’s when the decision makers of your business require more from each metric and each insight. It’s when the existing reporting limit you into submission, and there’s no choice but to upgrade to a more powerful solution.

**Scaling Your Reporting Demands for Growth**
---------------------------------------------

*Aside from needing greater visibility into business financials and operational data, decision-makers need to know more about what’s actually driving business growth — and what it’s going to take to keep moving forward.*

Financial professionals and decision makers of a growing business are constantly tasked to make use of information that’s:

- **On-demand** — So that issues can be quickly identified and problems solved anytime, anywhere.
- **In real-time** — For the most up-to-date data.
- **Relevant to every vertical** — Because numbers can be interpreted in different way by different people such as- management, admin, investors or partners.
- **Available in the most comprehensible formats** — Since different people ask for different insights in different ways, it needs to be both simple and actionable.

These are challenges that simply can’t be met by the manual, spreadsheet-based method of reporting, especially if you or your term depend on financial reports to take a new step or implement a newer strategy.

This is where business intelligence tools come in. But before going on the tools, let’s first understand what business reporting is in the first place.

**What is Business Reporting?**
-------------------------------

Also known as enterprise reporting, business reporting is basically “the public reporting of operating and financial data by a business enterprise,” and “the regular provision of information to decision-makers within an organization to support them in their work.” It’s an initiative by companies and organizations to move towards the sphere of business intelligence and knowledge management.

**What are Business Reporting Tools?**
--------------------------------------

[Business reporting software](https://giddh.com) or [business reporting tools](https://giddh.com/financial-reporting) are application software that can help collect volumes of unstructured data from internal and external systems such as books, journals, email, video and images. They help in identifying information with the help of queries. They can also help prepare data for analysis to create reports, dashboards, and data visualisations. This can empower both employees and managers to help take accurate decisions, accelerate efficiency of operations, analyse market trends, and identify KPIs and fresh revenue opportunities.

**Features of Business Intelligence Tools**
