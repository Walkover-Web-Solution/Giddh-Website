The thought of your sales team’s laptops and machines being stolen fills you with fear that serious business information may be negotiated or evermore lost.
9. **You are doing further accounting outside of your accounting software.** Outdated or not well accounting systems have a tendency to generate one-off lists and physically reorganized spreadsheets that are not linked and difficult to reunite. Without a central, holistic vision of your information, prospective growth is muffled, and making knowledgeable decisions about new product lines or places is nearly not possible, not to point out risky.
10. **You are inexperienced with resentment when seeing others run their businesses from a phone.** When replying a customer’s query means having to initially go into the office or call somebody else to assist, you are misplacing trustworthiness.
