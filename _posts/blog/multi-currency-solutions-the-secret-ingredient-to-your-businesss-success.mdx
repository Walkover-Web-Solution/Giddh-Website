After all‚Ä¶profits should know no borders‚Ä¶
-----------------------------------------

<img class="wp-block-image size-large" src ="https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*d5ybtD3tA8DDZ66378EDAw.png" />WE believe that your accounting solution needs to be global. Opportunities are no longer limited by borders.

To function well in a global marketplace, accountants and business owners alike need resources. Resources to grow, expand and make their mark in the world.

**Businesses Are taking the ‚ÄòGlocal‚Äô Approach-**
------------------------------------------------

Businesses of all sizes in our country are taking the advantage of technology to expand globally, accessing new markets to grow revenue. By taking their accounts to the cloud, business owners are adopting the most convenient way to manage their finances and streamline their processes. This leaves them more time to create better business and operation strategies.

Technology has enabled business of all sizes to operate at scale across multiple regions. But the shrinking world has brought its own set of challenges. This includes managing clients across the border while serving the ones that are local.

**New Business with Old System Was a Bad Idea üôÅ**
-------------------------------------------------

Before multi-currency solutions, serving International clients was complex for both the rapid growing businesses and the accountants associated with them.

Offline accounting systems tried to cater these businesses with multi-currency needs. But this was always been challenging as the information never got updated.

Using old data on exchange rate meant business decisions based on performance were hard to make. Not to mention, the hindrance of not being able to accept payment in ones own currency hampered the flow of finance of a business.

But that‚Äôs all changed. Our online accounting platform understands the needs of a business when it comes to accessing currency data.

Let‚Äôs delve in deeper to know, just how..
