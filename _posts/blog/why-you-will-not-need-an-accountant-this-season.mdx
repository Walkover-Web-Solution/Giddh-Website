Moreover, there are also present some good amount of reasons stating why you will not need an accountant this season:

**1. Emergence of online accounting**

This has got to be one of the most obvious reasons explaining why you are not going to need an accountant. Well, to be more on the explanatory side, who needs an accountant when EVERYTHING is going to be managed over the cloud? From your small transactions to those big-some graphs and reports, online accounting is there to ease all the complications.

**2. Gone are those paper-some days**

A paper here and a paper there, papers and papers everywhere. Do you remember those messy days when piles of papers decorated your desk, and you had no idea where exactly the required things are kept? And those days when even the smallest of the transactions needed to go on papers, thereby increasing the amount of papers you have?

> With the emergence of online accounting, one thing is for sure. You will not need papers, and when there would be no papers, there won’t be a need for someone to manage them.

**3. Almirahs to be replaced by cloud technology**

It is one of the most apparent reasons why you will not need an accountant this season. When the number of Almirahs which contained countless papers would be replaced by cloud technology, why would there be a need of an accountant who will take care of managing those Almirahs?

**4. Accuracy personified**

Agree or don’t agree, but the accuracy a machine gives, nothing else can. In today’s world where everything is happening at an incredible speed, even the tiniest of mistakes can take you far away from your oh-so-dear goals. So why would you want to mess with the accuracy when online accounting does not only get your things done at speed, but also ensures that they are done in an utmost accurate manner?

**5. More savings**

Have you ever given a thought to how much an accountant costs, and if the work done by him/her is exactly commendable and noteworthy? If you haven’t, then it’s time to think about it and see where you can save on the human resources part.

Also, it is a very basic thing that if everything can be done at ease with the help of online accounting alone, then what is the need of hiring accountants in abundance with whom there is no assurance of accuracy too.

> The reasons going in favour of why you will need an accountant this season are many. Try it on your own to believe in it.
