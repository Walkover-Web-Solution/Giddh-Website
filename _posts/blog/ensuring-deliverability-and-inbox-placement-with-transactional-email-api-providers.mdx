description: Back in the 90s era, Anu had been running her startup business and
  managing different aspects of its marketing quite well. However, she always
  took a step back when it came to managing the accounts and tax for her

  process back then, and required 100% accuracy, and because any slight mistake
  during the calculations could have hindered her business growth.  However,

  without taxes and accounting posing a hindrance is much easier with one

  softwares in India, but picking up the one that meets your requirements and
  streamlines your business operations in the simplest manner isn’t easy. In
  this blog post, we majorly will cover – what is GST software, the list of
  features your GST software should have, how can you file GST using the
  software, and what makes Giddh your preferred choice.  So, keep scrolling to
  learn more.
