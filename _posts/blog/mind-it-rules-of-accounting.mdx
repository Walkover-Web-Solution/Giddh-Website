description: Accounting follows a very simple double entry
---
**1)** Accounting follows a very simple double entry system which states that every accounting transaction has two sides — debit and credit. As addition (+) and subtraction (-) are to mathematics, so are debit (dr.) and credit (cr.) to accounting.

**2)** Every business has an asset and liability, where asset stands for anything the business **owns** and liability stands for anything the business **owes**.

**3)** Assets have a debit opening balance and liabilities have a credit opening balance (This rule applies in every accounting format that has a debit and credit side.)

**4)** Three types of accounts on the basis of which accounting entries are done:

a) Real account — debit what comes in, credit what goes out. (For ex.: Cash, Furniture, etc.)

b) Personal account — debit the receiver, credit the giver. (For ex.: Debtors account, Creditors account, etc.)

c) Nominal account — debit all expenses and losses, credit all incomes and gains. (For ex.: Rent account, discount account, etc.)
