**Accuracy**
------------

Not only is manual processing tedious, it is also prone to errors and compliance risks. With cloud-based accounting, duplicated entries, fraud, and other discrepancies can easily be detected because the whole process is fully automated. You also save time that would have been spent on checking or locating errors.

**Collaboration**
-----------------

Traditional accounting software only allows access to a single user. On the other hand, utilising cloud accounting with the reign of smartphones and other handheld devices lets users edit financial data and view real-time accounting information anytime, anywhere. It makes it easy for your team to collaborate. This means key people stay connected to their data and their accountants.

----------------

Everything is done online, which means you don’t need to install anything. Moreover, updates are done regularly and automatically. This financial benefit helps reduce overhead costs and other fees as they are managed by the cloud service provider.

------------

Cloud technology provides backup functionality to prevent the possibility of data loss. You can control the privacy access of confidential data. So even if your computer is stolen, your data is safe and backed up because it is stored elsewhere.

There’s no need to constantly worry about installations and maintenance; spend more time focusing on revenue-generating activities. Seeing your data streamlined gives you a clear overview of your finances at a glance.
