In 2024, over 12 million GST returns were filed in India, with businesses facing a constant challenge of maintaining compliance amid evolving tax regulations. The introduction of mandatory e-invoicing for businesses above a certain threshold has put even more pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMBs) to adapt swiftly.

Manual invoicing and compliance processes consume significant time and are prone to errors, thereby increasing the risk of penalties. With tax laws constantly evolving, many business owners, accountants, and CFOs feel overwhelmed by the complexity of manually managing GST filings.

This is where [**e-Invoice software India**](https://giddh.com/in/) can make all the difference. By automating the entire invoicing and filing process, businesses can stay ahead of compliance requirements, reducing human error and the time spent on repetitive tasks.

E-invoice software automates the invoicing and [GST compliance automation](https://giddh.com/blog/gst-compliant-accounting-software-for-businesses) processes, making them simpler and more efficient.
