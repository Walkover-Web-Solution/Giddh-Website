How can you define a ledger in accounting? The [meaning of "ledger" in accounting](https://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/what-is-a-general-ledger-account) refers to the daily business transaction records that accountants maintain. General ledger account examples include debt, depreciation, cash, inventory, salaries, fixed assets, income tax expense, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and stockholders’ equity. The beginning and ending balances are part of a ledger account, and adjustments to these balances are made during the accounting period. A transaction number is often associated with each transaction in the ledger account.

A General Ledger is the building block of financial records for a business. It is used to track all monetary transactions within the industry and is extremely useful for generating the business’s Income Statement and Balance Sheet. A single glance at the General Ledger should provide the reader with a quick idea of a company’s financial activity at any given point in time.

## What Is General Ledger Accounting?

General ledger accounting is the process of recording, organizing, and summarizing all financial transactions of a business into structured accounts. It serves as the backbone of accounting under key categories like assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses. A general ledger account contains every transaction of a business, and so it is used for [record-keeping](https://giddh.com/blog/tags/bookkeeping) during the life of a company.

The accounts in the general ledger can be used to create a balance sheet, an income statement, and [other financial reports](https://giddh.com/financial-reporting/) that are useful to the business.

- **Central System:** Foundation of business accounting and record-keeping.

- **Account Categories:** Revenue, assets, liabilities, expenses, equity.

- **Transaction Tracking:** Consolidates entries from sub-ledgers to provide a comprehensive view of transactions.

- **Financial Reporting:** The basis for reports such as the balance sheet and income statement.

- **Decision Support:** Enables data-driven business insights and compliance.

- **Lifecycle Record:** Maintains full financial history of the company.

## How to Prepare a General Ledger Account

You must understand the general ledger format and the rules for ledger posting. Business transactions are initially recorded in a journal and then posted to the general ledger. The posting process involves entering general journal entries into the ledger accounts. General ledger accounts group transactions that fall under the same account.

When the posting takes place, the journal entry is divided into two sections: debit and credit. The debit entry is written on the debit side of the account it belongs to, and the credit entry is written on the credit side of the account it belongs to in the general ledger.

## Types of general ledgers

![Types of general ledgers](/img/blog/general-ledger/types_of_general_ledgers.webp)

As stated earlier, the general ledger can be divided into five categories: assets, liabilities, revenue or income, expenses, and equity or capital.

### **Assets**

Assets are resources owned by a business that are used for its operations. These are categorized as current (short-term) or non-current (long-term), further split into tangible and intangible assets.

- **Current Assets:** Easily convertible to cash (e.g., inventory, receivables).

- **Non-current Assets:** Long-term (valid over a year).

  - **Tangible:** Physical assets like buildings, computers.

  - **Intangible:** Non-physical, like patents, trademarks.

### **Revenue**

Revenue accounts reflect the income earned by a business. It includes earnings from core operations or secondary, non-operational sources.

- **Operating Revenue:** Income from primary activities (e.g., sales, rent).

- **Non-operating Revenue:** Income from external sources (e.g., interest, dividends).

- Helps track business profitability and performance.

### **Liabilities**

Liabilities are obligations the business owes to others. These are categorized into current (short-term) and non-current (long-term) liabilities.

- **Current Liabilities:** Payable within 1 year (e.g., salaries, accounts payable).

- **Non-current Liabilities:** Due after 1 year (e.g., long-term loans).

- Crucial for assessing financial obligations and creditworthiness.

### **Expenses**

Expenses are costs incurred by a business to generate revenue. These include both direct and indirect costs necessary for operations.

- **Direct Expenses:** Tied to production (e.g., raw materials).

- **Indirect Expenses:** General business costs (e.g., rent, utilities).

- Affect profit margins and operational efficiency.

### **Equity**

Equity represents the owner’s share or interest in the business. It reflects the residual value after all liabilities are deducted from assets.

- **Capital Account:** Tracks owner investment and withdrawals.

- **Credit Balance:** Indicates profits or capital inflow.

- **Debit Balance:** Indicates losses or capital withdrawal.

- Found at the bottom of the balance sheet.

### **Non-Operating Revenue Ledger**

Captures income not related to core operations, such as interest income, dividends, or asset sales.

- Tracks secondary income sources

- Useful for complete financial reporting

- Shows total earning capacity of the business

- Helps differentiate operational vs. non-operational profits

### **Non-Operating Expense Ledger**

Records expenses not tied to day-to-day operations, such as interest paid on loans, penalties, or lawsuit settlements.

- Identifies non-core costs

- Helpful in adjusting net income

- Aids in expense classification

- Helps assess actual operational efficiency
