![Manage HR Effortlessly with HR and Accounting Software](/img/blog/hr-and-accounting-software-for-small-businesses/manage_hr_effortlessly_with_hr_and_accounting_software.png)

According to recent data, about [70% of businesses report encountering payroll](https://www.blinkpayroll.com/blog/20-payroll-statistics-you-need-to-know-in-2024) issues, and nearly 82 million Americans have faced paycheck discrepancies at some point.

Managing HR and accounting functions can feel overwhelming, with multiple tasks competing for attention. From payroll mistakes to compliance issues and disconnected systems, the challenges can be overwhelming. If you're dealing with manual data entry, struggling with poorly integrated software, or trying to keep up with ever-changing tax regulations, you're not alone—many businesses are facing the same obstacles.

The right HR and [accounting software can revolutionize](https://giddh.com/blog/giddh-books-revolutionizing-modern-accounting?page=1) the way you handle your workforce and finances. These solutions automate payroll, ensure compliance with tax and labor laws, simplify expense tracking, and seamlessly integrate employee data with financial reports—ultimately reducing administrative stress and minimizing costly errors.

With years of experience researching, testing, and writing about HR and accounting software, we've helped businesses find the tools that work. In this guide, we’ll sift through the noise to present the best options so that you can make a confident and informed choice.

## **How Accounting Software Can Boost HR Efficiency in Small Businesses**

Small businesses and startups may not be able to afford a comprehensive HR system, software, or a dedicated team for managing employees and their needs. However, several factors can be automated through online accounting software. Here’s a list of some.

### **Accounting software frees your staff.**

In small businesses and startups, employees often have to take on multiple job opportunities. Cloud-based accounting software gives your employees more free time to engage in innovative and productive activities. For instance, [accounting software such as Giddh](https://giddh.com/blog/7-features-of-giddh-accounting-software-that-help-smes?page=4) offers access to sales report generation to the sales staff. This team can generate these reports simply by entering a few details and doesn’t need to spend a lot of time creating charts or presentations. As a result, the sales staff can focus on following up on leads or creating new lead generation systems.

### **Keep your information safe.**

A vital task in human resource management is to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information and ensure that employees don’t disclose it to unauthorized parties. If you choose a reputable [accounting software for businesses](https://giddh.com/blog/how-to-use-accounting-software-for-business?page=1), you will also benefit from increased security. Since great online accounting software will have sensible user controls, not all staff can have access to all the information. When updates or changes are made on the cloud, notifications are sent only to the relevant staff.

### **Employee productivity**

To err is human. And there’s no way to eliminate errors made by employees. But each error incurs a certain cost. Some common errors that can be addressed with the help of accounting software are:

– Financial reports generated on accounting software help you compare the actual financial situation.

– Discrepancies between timecards can be easily addressed on accounting software.

– Sales reports can be made accurate by generating them right on the accounting software, eliminating any chances of faulty sales performance analysis.

### **Employee performance**

An additional point to the above is the ease of assessing employee performance. You can create a statistical overview of performance on an accounting software. Each department can have its performance report quantified under specific parameters, and this can be recorded in the software. It frees up the HR person, who can then channelize energy into training under-performing employees.

### **Payroll management**

A payroll management head can be easily created on a cloud-based [accounting software](https://giddh.com/blog/why-your-startup-needs-an-online-accounting-software?page=3). It, like any other expense, does not require any additional software. With a bit of training, any staff member can use it while applying user controls, so not everyone has access to this information. You can also manage the following things on an accounting software –

– Employee time

– Delivering pay stubs

– Paying employees
