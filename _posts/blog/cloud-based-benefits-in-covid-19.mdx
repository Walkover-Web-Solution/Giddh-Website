There is an old saying

*“Crisis is an opportunity riding on a dangerous wind”*

With news about the coronavirus and its seriousness changing day by day all over the world, businesses world over should remember this saying. The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the world is affecting the economy and general business conditions as we know it. For most businesses, the crisis has resulted in a temporary decrease in income. So organizations that are not responding to these challenges brought forth by the pandemic are without a doubt putting themselves at risk.

--------------------------------------

There is always a chance where there is a change.

Such as the increasing affinity towards home culture that ensures work is done while also maintaining social distancing and the safety of employees. Numerous organizations have chosen to let their workers work from home in this regard.

This is great if you were an employee who just needs a basic spreadsheet or a word processor. For accounting staff tied to their work-desktop software, this can get extremely challenging. Even worse – imagine having an IT-Team also come to work during these times in the event of a software crash!

By abandoning the hassles of offline licensed accounting software and adopting cloud accounting software like Giddh, you can ensure your organization is future-ready and disaster-proof.

Giddh’s cloud-based software ensures your accounting staff can work from the safety of their home on any device that has a web browser. Remote 24×7 support is readily available at your disposal to handhold users when they require assistance.

Early Cloud Adoption Pays Off Big For Businesses
------------------------------------------------

To be frank, in the year 2020 there are not many reasons why any little to mid-sized organization or association should be running their accounting software on a desktop or server-based software. Cloud-based solutions like Giddh offer the full experience of a dedicated accounting software without the complications of offline license checks, system errors, computer crashes, etc. To give your CA or accountant secure access, you basically set up a client ID with their email address, set their permissions and you’re good to go!

The Future is in the Cloud
--------------------------

Cloud-based software has been increasingly adopted by new businesses and huge organizations. Consider these experiences for reference to better understand the prevalence of cloud tech in our daily lives:

- We no longer use word processors, instead we use Google Docs
- We no longer download movies offline, instead we stream it off Netflix and Prime
- We no longer download music, or rip CDs, instead we use services like Spotify.
- There will no longer be a need to download games with the advent of services like Stadia and PS Now

The increase in internet bandwidth with lowering costs and the shift away from desktops to tablets and smartphones has increased the proliferation of such “light-weight”alternatives that truly help us take our world wherever we go.
