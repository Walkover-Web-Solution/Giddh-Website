This blog aims to help you understand how [GST filing software helps businesses](https://giddh.com/blog/giddh-keeping-indian-business-owners-gst-compliant-future-proof?page=3) stay compliant, ensures accurate filings, and ultimately saves time, effort, and potential penalties.

## How the Best GST Filing Software Helps You Stay Compliant?

### **1\. Automated Calculations and Data Entry: The Foundation of Accuracy**

The most common way businesses deal with GST is through manual data entry and calculations, which are highly prone to errors. A simple mistake in calculating CGST, SGST, or IGST can lead to incorrect filings.

For example, a small business owner might forget to factor in certain expenses or input the wrong tax rate, resulting in the wrong GST amount being paid. Mistakes like these can result in penalties or fines, which can significantly affect a business’s financial health.

**Software’s Precision**

GST filing software simplifies this process by automating the core tasks that were previously done manually. Here’s how it ensures precision and helps businesses stay compliant:

1. **Automated Tax Calculations**: GST filing software automatically calculates the appropriate CGST, SGST, IGST, and cess based on predefined tax rates, transaction details, and input values. This eliminates the risk of human error in tax calculations.  
   For example, if a business buys goods worth ₹100,000, the software will automatically calculate the applicable taxes and provide the correct GST amount to be paid.
2. **Seamless Data Import**: By integrating with existing business systems, businesses can import data directly from invoices, bank statements, and accounting software. This feature eliminates the need for manually entering data into multiple systems, reducing the chances of transcription errors.  
   For instance, businesses that use ERP or POS systems can directly link these systems, ensuring that all transaction details are captured accurately without manual data input.

_The [**ledger-based entry system within** **Giddh**](https://giddh.com/in/gst) simplifies the tax filing process by accurately recording every transaction from the point of entry. This ensures that businesses can rely on precise data throughout their GST filing process._

### **2\. Streamlined Return Filing Process: Effortless Submissions**

Filing GST returns can be a daunting task. Businesses are required to submit different forms like GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, and GSTR-9, each with its specific requirements and deadlines. Missing a deadline or submitting incomplete or incorrect information could result in fines, penalties, or even an audit.

For small and medium businesses, navigating these forms can be time-consuming and confusing, especially when dealing with multiple deadlines.

**Software’s Simplification**

GST filing software simplifies this process in several ways:

1. **Pre-filled Forms**: **GST filing software** automatically populates GST forms with accurate data from your transactions, eliminating the need for manual entry. Whether it's GSTR-1 or GSTR-3B, the software fills in the fields with correct details, ensuring there’s no need to double-check the same information across different forms.

2. **Direct Integration with GST Portal**: It connects directly with the [GST portal, allowing businesses to file returns](https://giddh.com/blog/gst-impact-on-indian-smes-working-capital?page=2) without needing to download and upload files manually. This integration enables companies to submit their returns instantly, eliminating the risk of technical issues during uploads.

3. **Compliance Alerts and Reminders**: The Best GST filing software automatically sends notifications for upcoming deadlines and potential discrepancies. These timely reminders ensure that businesses never miss a filing deadline or overlook a required action, thus helping them avoid penalties and late fees.

### **3\. Improved Input Tax Credit (ITC) Management: Maximising Your Benefits**

Input Tax Credit (ITC) is one of the most beneficial aspects of the GST system, allowing businesses to claim credits on the taxes they’ve paid for goods and services.

However, the process of claiming ITC can be tricky. Companies need to reconcile their purchase data with supplier data to ensure they are claiming the correct ITC. Without an automated system, the risk of mismatched invoices, missing data, or clerical errors increases, leading to ITC leakage and financial loss.

**Software’s Solution**

Online GST filing software addresses these challenges by automating the reconciliation process:

1. **Accurate ITC Claims**: [GST accounting software](https://giddh.com/blog/which-accounting-software-is-best-in-india-for-gst?page=4) automatically reconciles purchase invoices with supplier GSTR-2A/2B data, ensuring that businesses claim all eligible ITC. For example, if a company has purchased raw materials worth ₹50,000, the software will ensure the correct ITC is claimed based on the supplier’s filed data.

2. **Reduced ITC Leakage**: By tracking data in real-time, the software ensures that businesses don’t miss out on eligible ITC due to discrepancies. Real-time reconciliation prevents potential mismatches and ensures companies can claim all credits they are entitled to, thereby optimising cash flow.

**\*Giddh** offers powerful **automated reconciliation** features that significantly reduce the chances of ITC leakage. The software matches purchase data with supplier GSTR-2A/2B data in real-time, ensuring businesses claim every penny of eligible ITC.\*

### **4\. Enhanced Record-Keeping and Audit Preparedness: Integration with accounting software**

GST mandates businesses to maintain accurate and detailed records of their transactions for a minimum of six years. Maintaining physical copies of these records, especially for companies with large volumes of transactions, can be challenging. Moreover, companies need to ensure that they have easy access to these records during audits or inspections.

**Software’s Contribution**

[GST software for small businesses](https://giddh.com/blog/how-can-you-free-up-your-time-in-business?page=4) helps maintain a central, accessible, and secure repository of their records:

1. **Centralised Data Storage**: **Giddh** stores all GST-related documents—like invoices, ledgers, returns, and other vital records in a single, secure location.

### 5\. Staying Updated with Regulatory Changes: Future-Proofing Your Business

GST regulations are frequently updated, and businesses must stay on top of these changes to ensure compliance. Manually tracking changes in GST rates, laws, and filing procedures is not only time-consuming but also error-prone.
