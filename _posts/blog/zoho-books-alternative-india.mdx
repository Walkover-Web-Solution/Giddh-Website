Accounting software plays a crucial role in simplifying the financial operations of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). However, choosing the right solution can be a daunting task. In India, many SMBs struggle with finding software that balances affordability, user-friendliness, and local compliance. A recent report suggests that over 70% of businesses in India still rely on traditional bookkeeping methods or inefficient solutions, primarily due to the complexity and high costs of [global accounting software solutions](https://giddh.com/in) like Zoho Books.

While Zoho Books is popular, it's not always the perfect fit for Indian businesses. Its steep pricing and complex features often overwhelm smaller companies. Furthermore, its localization for Indian tax laws—especially GST—leaves much to be desired.

This is where **Giddh**, a powerful [Zoho Books alternative in India](https://giddh.com/blog/zoho-books-alternatives-competitors), steps in. With its affordability, ease of use, and seamless GST compliance, Giddh is quickly becoming a favorite among Indian SMBs. Let’s dive into why Giddh might be the solution your business needs.

## Why Businesses in India Are Looking for Zoho Books Alternatives

Indian SMBs face unique challenges that many global [accounting software platforms](https://giddh.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-accounting-software-for-your-business?page=2), including Zoho Books, struggle to address effectively. Here are some of the primary reasons why businesses in India are seeking **Zoho Books alternatives**:

#### **1\. High Pricing and Overwhelming Features**

While Zoho Books offers a wide range of features, its pricing can be prohibitive for small businesses. SMBs with limited resources often find Zoho’s feature set more than what they need, resulting in underutilized tools and unnecessary expenses.

#### **2\. Limited Localization for Indian GST Compliance**

Zoho Books, although widely used, doesn't always stay ahead of India’s frequent tax law changes. This lack of seamless GST integration means businesses must often do manual updates, leading to costly errors.

#### **3\. Complex Interface and Usability**

Many businesses find Zoho Books’ interface overwhelming. It is designed for a wide range of use cases, and the complexity can be daunting for SMBs that don’t need a full suite of advanced features. For finance professionals and business owners who want quick access to key accounting functions, simplicity is paramount.

#### **4\. Support Challenges for Indian Users**

While Zoho Books offers support, it’s often more geared toward global users, making it harder for Indian businesses to get timely, localized assistance. Support teams that are not fully aligned with Indian accounting and tax regulations can lead to delays and frustration.

For businesses seeking a more tailored approach, **Giddh** stands out as a compelling **Zoho Books competitor**, addressing these challenges with a simpler, more cost-effective, and locally compliant solution.
