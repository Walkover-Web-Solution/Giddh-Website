### **Role-Based Access**

* **User Permissions**: Assign different roles (e.g., finance manager, accountant, CEO) with varying levels of access to data and features.

* **Audit Trail for Access**: Track who accessed or modified financial data, helping to maintain internal security and accountability.

* **Secure Data Sharing**: Protect financial data when sharing with external stakeholders (auditors, partners, tax consultants) by ensuring encryption and controlled access.

* **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive financial systems, especially when dealing with high-value transactions.

* **Separation of Duties**: For larger teams, ensure segregation of responsibilities (e.g., one person can’t approve and process a payment).

### **Support & Localization**

A high-quality financial management software should adapt to the local business culture and provide efficient support whenever needed.

* **Local Language Support**: Given India’s linguistic diversity, the software should support multiple languages, including Hindi, Marathi, and Tamil.
