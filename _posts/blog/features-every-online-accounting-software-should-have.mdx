Audit trail is something which looks small from business point of view but holds huge importance to the end user. What if the user needs to have a look at the deleted transactions? Or, what if the user wants to retrieve the transactions he deleted by mistake? The feature of Audit trail comes very handy at that time since keeps a trail of everything and lets the user know about it.

2\. Certified by an online secure tool

It is also important for the online accounting software to be certified by an online secure tool, possibly, Trust E or VeriSign, or any other such secure tool. This is because the end user will lose interest in proceeding with online transactions since they are not secured.

The online accounting software should also be able to sync with the bank so that all the information with the bank and information with self can be exchanged easily.
