Every business, no issue how large or small, must have some kind of bookkeeping system in place. Keeping exact records will permit the business owner to be on top of organizational profits and losses. Businesses have been known to fall short because the owner was not aware of how money was being used up, what returns was coming in and what bills had to be remunerated.

It is suggested that you stock up all invoices, receipts, and paperwork for at least five years.

**Individual and business expenditures should be separated**
