What is Cloud Accounting Software?
----------------------------------

In layman’s terms, the cloud is a generic term that defines data that resides on different servers all of which are connected via the internet giving you access to the same data from any internet-enabled device.

Similarly, cloud accounting refers to the storage of data on remote servers further allowing the users to interact with the financial data, perform online transactions, and save it back within the software instantly in real-time.

One of the significant **benefits of cloud-based accounting software** is that you can access the data from anywhere, any device, without physical location posing a hindrance. You simply need your login credentials to get access to the online software or Sign Up in case you’re registering as a new user. You don’t have to worry about hardware maintenance, installation, licensing, or running an outdated version as the online accounting software is always up-to-date and accessible.

Most businesses are switching over to online cloud accounting software since they make business operations and financial information management easier. If you haven’t yet switched over to accounting software on cloud, then you might want to look at the [**accounting software features**](https://giddh.com/blog/10-accounting-software-features) –

**Speed** – All your normal daily operations can be completed at lightning speed. The automation can bring in a welcome change in your functioning and help your employees get more work done and process more data. No more wasting time posting or chasing invoices. With the accounting cloud based software, you can generate automatic invoices. It can also help you to keep track of all your debtors and provide timely reminders to make payments. The software can also help avoid any unnecessary duplications as well as other human errors. Since they are regularly updated automatically, you can expect fast and accurate financial operations without any intervention.

**Security** – One of the common concerns for CFOs and other financial personnel can be the security of software. Vulnerable software can not only result in loss of data but also lead to leak of confidential information. Using backup systems doesn’t help much since they end up creating duplicate versions of files, plus storage costs can be quite cumbersome. With cloud accounting software, the data can be backed up and stored on an offline server. This can immune businesses to losses from virus, theft, or accidents and still help you retain your data. Moreover you can choose who gets access to what section thereby resulting in a peace of mind

**Centralised access** – Cloud-based accounting helps in centralised access to all data as well as offers collaborative opportunities. This reduces clutter since different departments and employees can work on a single file without creating multiple versions of it. It also makes user access and login permissions easy so that everyone can access the file without difficulties. It’s also possible to access the data from anywhere and on any device.

**Scalability** – One of the best advantages of cloud-based accounting software is that they can be customised to meet the needs of small as well as large businesses. Because of this scalability, you can easily expand the functions of the software to meet the needs of your growing business.

Besides, they also don’t need much IT staff to maintain or update their accounting system. For on-premise accounting systems, it’s exactly opposite. As the business grows, firms have to spend more on software licenses, maintenance costs, buying new infrastructure and assigning more staff to manage the infrastructure.

**Issues with Offline Traditional Accounting Software**
-------------------------------------------------------

- Neither the software nor the data is up-to-date.
- The software works only on one computer and data frisks from one place to another, like on a USB drive. This is not reliable or secure.
- User access is only for one person. Other important persons cannot access details of customers or finances.
- It is complicated and costly to maintain back-ups of information.
- It is time-consuming, difficult and expensive to upgrade software.
- Customer support is slow and expensive.

Moreover, you wouldn’t be able to trace if someone stole or copied confidential data from your system. But with a cloud-based accounting system, you don’t have to worry about that as nothing is stored locally on your system. You can use your credentials to get access to your data from using any computer.

**Not backing up your data:** Needless to say, backing up data regularly is the most important part of protecting your data. Moreover, you also need to protect and organise the backed-up data so that you can restore them when it’s needed.
