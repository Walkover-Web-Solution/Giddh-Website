  The best part about this software solution is that it helps your clients create their payments dashboard, which can then help them track all of their invoices and payments on a single screen. The software also helps your clients make payments from anywhere, and at any time, using a number of payment gateways. What’s more, your clients can even make their due payments through their smartphones. Giddh’s online invoice software from India can be accessed from cell phones, and clients can track their invoices and manage payments directly from anywhere – it truly can’t get simpler than this.

4. **Follow-up reminders can be sent:**  
  How often have you had to follow-up with a client for a payment? Business owners frequently need to follow up with different clients for payments, but this can be a tedious job since you will need to keep track of all the invoices you’ve sent but are yet to receive the payment. You’ll also need to manually send a reminder to each client. But, with online invoicing software, you can send follow-up reminders directly through the automated settings on the tool.

5. **User-friendly and reliable:**  
  Giddh’s India-based online invoice software is extremely user-friendly. This means you don’t have to allocate additional resources to train your staff on how to use the platform.

6. **Improves cash flow:**   
  The whole purpose of your business is to offer your services or products to your clients and get paid for it. But, if you are having trouble raising invoices and getting paid, your business cash flow will likely suffer over time. Online invoicing software can be of immense help here since it helps you accelerate the entire invoicing process and bring in the payments due quickly.

  If you rely on traditional methods to send your invoice to your clients, there’s always a chance that the invoice may get lost. If this happens, you’ll need to create the invoice again, and then repost it to your client – again, there is no guarantee that it will reach them safely. Even if your client does receive your invoice, there’s always a chance that they may miss seeing it amongst all the paperwork they get. Online invoice software eliminates such problems, and you’ll always have a digital copy of your invoice for reference even years from when you raise the invoice.

8. **A lot less paperwork:**  
  With companies becoming greener and reducing their carbon footprint, it will certainly benefit your business and society at large to avoid paperwork and opt for an online invoicing solution. The problem with traditional invoicing is that it can take up a lot of desk space, and there’s a high probability that important invoices may get misplaced. Online invoicing solves this problem since you have a lot less paperwork to deal with. You will also have easy and quick access to all your invoices as an when you need them
