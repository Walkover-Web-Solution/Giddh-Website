The current pandemic is infiltrating our work environments and giving rise to a “new normal”. This abrupt shift is impacting all spheres and departments of the organizations including the accounting and finance department and they are constantly hosting webinars to deliver traditional services digitally and remotely.

This new remote lifestyle is now enforcing new standards of social interaction and paving the way for the establishment of newer and different systems and processes within the organization. The new culture has now given a rise to different choices of platforms like Microsoft Teams, Skype for Business, Slack, etc. for seamless communication. Hence, accountants too are managing the financial transactions away from their official workstations and hence from desktop accounting software.
