						<h1 class="text-uppercase">What is GST</h1>

						<p>GST stands for Goods and Service Tax. The implementation of GST is one of the biggest tax reforms in India and for the first time, the nation has a uniform tax structure under a single authority. It was implemented as a bill passed in the Rajya Sabha on 03.08.2016 and then in the Lok Sabha on 08.08.2016. It was notified as a Constitution Act (101st Amendment ), 2016 on 08.09.2016. GST is a tax that is applicable to goods as well as services. Goods are defined as all commodities, materials and articles while services are anything other than goods. </p>

						<p>The GST law has unique principles and is inspired by the GST structures of other countries such as Australia, the European Union as well as the international guidelines recommended by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Since the country allows both the centre and the states to levy taxes, the GST structure has a dual system that allows the states and the central taxes to function independently. </p>

						<h2 class="text-uppercase"><span class="d-inline-block d-md-none">1.</span> The salient features of the GST are:</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>The GST is under the purview of the GST council that consists of the Finance Ministers of all the states and headed by the Union Finance Minister.</li>
							<li>There is concurrent jurisdiction for the centre and the states to levy GST.</li>
							<li>There is a four-tiered structure of slabs at 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28% for various product and service categories. Some categories of essentials such as wheat and rice have 0% GST. </li>
							<li>There are goods and services that are not under the GST umbrella, namely; alcohol for human consumption, five petroleum products and the entertainment tax
							levied by local bodies. The GST Council will decide the date from which GST will be
							applicable for crude oil, diesel, petrol, natural gas and ATF. Tobacco is a part of GST but the power to levy additional excise duty is still with the centre. </li>
							<li>GST is levied on the amount value-added at each stage. The final end customer bears the GST only of the final stage.</li>
							<li>Interstate commerce and imports will come under GST levied by the centre.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The GST has replaced all the other indirect taxes that were collected earlier such as </p>
						<ul>
							<li>central excise duties</li>
							<li>additional and special additional customs duty</li>
							<li>service taxes, state VAT</li>
							<li>central sales tax, etc</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Earlier there were different central taxes that came under different rules and administrations. There were different procedures for each tax. The state taxes were individual to each state with multiple taxes, rules, acts and procedures. GST has made the entire procedure computerised and uniform. There is a single law, one administration and uniform procedures. This unified system ensures that there is no cascading and repetitive levy of taxes on the same goods or services. This will support the economic growth of the country by reducing the time, effort and cost that are spent on taxes. It will add to the ease and transparency of transacting business.</p>

						<p>The practical implementation of the GST will be done by the GSTN (Goods and Services Tax Network) which is a non-government firm created with the NDSL (National Securities Depository Limited). The GSTN will be in charge of the provision of IT infrastructure for the implementation and regulation of the GST. </p>

						<p>There are around 160 countries that have implemented the GST tax system in different forms since France became the first country to implement it in 1954. Some of the countries are Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Brazil, Singapore, Spain, Monaco and Italy.</p>

						<h2 class="text-uppercase"><span class="d-inline-block d-md-none">2.</span> Types of GST</h2>

						<p>The three main types of GST are Central Goods & Service Tax (CGST), State Goods & Services Tax (SGST) and the Integrated Goods & Services Tax (IGST). A fourth type is the Union Territory Goods & Services Tax (UTGST). In India, taxes are levied by the centre and state. The jurisdiction for the centre and the states to levy taxes are concurrent.</p>

						<h3>Central Goods & Service Tax (CGST)</h3>

						<p>The Central Goods & Service Tax (CGST) is governed by the Central Goods & Services Tax Act 2016. It is the tax that replaces all the taxes and duties that were formerly levied by the centre under various heads such as service tax, excise duties, customs duties etc. The taxes that are collected under the CGST belong to the central government and can be amended by a body that functions under the centre. The input tax under this head is given to the state governments and they have to pay the CGST to utilise it.</p> 

						<h3>State Goods & Services Tax (SGST)</h3>

						<p>The GST that is collected by the states is called the State Goods & Services Tax or SGST. It replaces the taxes and levies that were made by each of the state governments earlier including those such as entry tax, octroi, state sales tax, luxury tax, etc. The revenue collected under the SGST belongs to the state government and function under the state authority for the SGST. This state authority is governed by the central GST body. </p>

						<h3>Integrated Goods & Services Tax (IGST)<h3>

						<p>The IGST or the Integrated Goods & Services Tax is applicable to the goods and services that are supplied from one state to another. This tax is collected by the centre and can be changed whenever required by the Goods and Services Tax Council of India.</p>

						<h3>Union Territory Goods & Services Tax (UTGST)<h3>

						<p>The tax that replaces all the taxes and levies that were formerly made by the Union Territories is called the Union Territory Goods & Services Tax or the UTGST. </p>

						<h3>The Four Tiers Of GST<h3>

						<p>GST has been formulated with a four-tiered structure that has slabs with different rates, namely; Zero Rate, Lower Rate, Standard Rates and Higher Rate.</p>

						<h3>Zero Rate - 0%<h3>

						<p>Certain goods and services that are considered to be essentials have been put under the zero-rate slab of the GST structure. They attract no GST. These goods and services include unpacked food grains, milk, health and educational services.</p>

						<h3>Lower Rate - 5%<h3>

						<p>Certain other essential items attract a lower rate of GST to protect people from the effect of inflation on daily essentials. These are tea, sugar, spices, edible oils, coal, cotton fabric etc. This lower rate is currently at 5%. </p>

						<h3>Standard Rate- 12% and 18%<h3>

						<p>There are two standard rates of 12% and 18 % that are applicable based on the category of goods and services. The 12% rate applies to items such as mobile phones and processed food while the 18% rate applies to computers, capital goods and industry intermediaries. </p>

						<h3>Higher Rate - 28%<h3>

						<p>The higher rate of GST is applicable on white goods such as high-end motorcycles, small cars, washing machines, refrigerators, etc. </p>

						<h3>Additional Cess<h3>

						<p>To prevent certain goods such as aerated drinks, tobacco etc from being too cheaply available the government has levied an additional cess over and above the higher rate of 28%. This will apply to demerit goods such as pan masala, tobacco, coal, motor vehicles and aerated drinks. </p>

						<h2 class="text-uppercase"><span class="d-inline-block d-md-none">3.</span> Impact of GST on Small and Medium Enterprises</h2>

						<p>The impact of the GST reforms is multifold. The most immediate and salient benefits for small and medium businesses are</p>

						<h3>1. Simple and Easy to Understand</h3>
						<p>The earlier cascading tax regime was exceedingly hard to understand and comply with, especially for a business person not familiar with the rules of another state. It would take a taxation expert to be able to easily manage and file the taxes properly to different authorities. With the GST regime, there are only two authorities, the central and the state and the GSTN portal makes filing an easy process. </p>.

						<h3>2. Takes the Pain Out of Starting a Business</h3>
						<p>When a startup had to register to do business across states it involved a lot of paperwork. The entire process was different in different states and the business would have to go through the process in all the states that they intended to do business in. However, with a uniform tax and uniform rules, the process of <a target="_blank" href="https://giddh.com/gst/">registration under</a> GST is transparent and simple. And growing to expand to more regions and states is easy.</p>

						<h3>3. Interstate Logistics are Easier</h3>
						<p>Under the earlier tax regime, the physical transportation of goods across state borders would need endless paperwork and cause long queues at border check posts. This would result in added costs of transportation and labour with the goods and their transport lying idle sometimes for days on end at check-posts. Now, this bottleneck to the smooth flow of goods across the country has been removed. This makes doing interstate business easier and less expensive and risky than before. </p>

						<h3>4. Goods and Services</h3>
						<p>Goods and services had different taxes and an invoice would have to be made separately for each with taxes being levied under different heads. With the new integrated goods and services regime, the tax is levied on the amount making it easier for SMEs to calculate and avail tax benefits for input goods and services.</p>

						<h3>5. New Threshold Limits for Startups</h3>
						<p>The threshold limit for the GST taxes on smaller businesses especially startups, is a great benefit to SMEs. The lower taxation rate for businesses with a smaller turnover is creating an ideal environment to help small and startup businesses to grow with a lesser tax burden.</p>

						<h2 class="text-uppercase"><span class="d-inline-block d-md-none">4.</span> There are certain features of the GST that could be seen as disadvantageous for SMEs. They are:</h2>

						<h3>1. Transition Pains</h3>
						<p>It is always a little difficult for people who are set in the old ways to change to something new even if it is easier. The entire process is online and people who are unfamiliar with the internet have a steep learning curve.</p>

						<h3>2. Monthly Returns</h3>
						<p>GST requires that you file your returns every month. So, a business will have to be up-to-date with their accounts and paperwork and close accounts every month. A missed return will be fined and there will be a negative impact on the rating of the business with GSTN. With an SME failing to file a return, it cannot claim any tax credits and the customers who have transacted with the business cannot claim their input credit.</p>

						<h3>3. No Threshold Exemptions for eCommerce</h3>
						<p>All businesses that are involved in eCommerce will have to register under GST. They do not have the threshold exemptions that a smaller non-eCommerce business would enjoy. An eCommerce firm would mandatorily have to register in every single state that they supply to.</p>

						<h2 class="text-uppercase"><span class="d-inline-block d-md-none">5.</span>Life before GST</h2>

						<p>The setting up of any business under the previous tax system required many different taxes and procedures under different authorities both central and state. The state-level taxes were different in each state. This made both setting up businesses and calculating and paying taxes difficult. One would have to hire an expert to step in and provide expert advice. Taxes were calculated on the value of the goods or the services that were being sold. </p>

						<p>GST only taxes the value addition at each stage of the supply chain starting with the process of raw material through stages of manufacturing distribution and final sale. GST also gives credit for the input tax that has been paid at the previous stage of the supply chain. So, if a person pays the tax that applies to his/her sale and then claims the input credit of the tax that he/she had paid to procure the item sold, it is only the actual difference amount that the person is actually paying.</p>

						<h3>Example:</h3>
						<p>We can illustrate this with an example of a product XYZ. </p>

						<h4>Previous Tax Regime</h4>

						<p>In this example, we presume that the VAT in the first state is 10% and the VAT in the second state is 12%. The interstate central sales tax (ICST) is presumed to be 12%. For the sake of this example, we also presume that the manufacturer of XYZ has paid all the taxes for the manufacturing process of XYZ. </p>

						<p>The manufacturer of XYZ sells his product to a wholesaler in the same state at Rs.100 per piece plus taxes. The taxes in the same state are a VAT of 10%. This makes the amount that the wholesaler pays for each item of XYZ Rs. 110. The wholesaler then increases the rate of XYZ to Rs. 200 and sells it to a retailer in another state. This attracts an interstate central sales tax (CST) of 12 %. This makes the rate paid by the retailer for each XYZ Rs. 224. The retailer decides to mark the selling price of XYZ at 25% more than he purchased it making it Rs. 280 per piece. When he sells it to the customer it attracts a VAT of 12%. The customer pays Rs. 313.60 for XYZ.</p>

						<p>Here we see that as there are different values of VAT that are levied by different authorities in each state it would be impossible to calculate and claim the input tax credit. </p>

						<h4>GST Regime</h4>

						<p>Now we can take the same example under the GST system. The manufacturer sells XYZ to the wholesaler in the same state at Rs. 100 per piece plus a GST of 10% making the amount paid by the wholesaler Rs. 110. This wholesaler then increases the rate to Rs. 200 and sells the product to a retailer in another state attracting an IGST of 10% making the price paid by the retailer Rs. 220. The retailer increases the price by 25% marking it at Rs. 275. The end customer buys it at Rs. 275 plus 10% GST amounting to Rs. 302.50. </p>

						<p>Here we can see that the GST levied on the product XYZ has been the same 10% throughout. The interstate IGST was only levied when the product was sold between two states. Each person at each stage of the supply chain can avail input tax credit on the SGST and CGST. The calculation and claiming of the input tax credit at every stage is much easier when it is uniform and under the same authority. This will benefit the end customer if the sellers choose to pass on this benefit to them. It benefits the manufacturer, wholesaler and the retailer as well as they can claim an input tax credit for their purchases and only bear the burden of the additional tax that their value addition attracts. </p>

						<h2 class="text-uppercase"><span class="d-inline-block d-md-none">6.</span>Advantages of GST (provide example)</h2>

						<p>The advantages of GST have been felt in businesses ranging from the smallest startups to pan Indian corporates. It is also greatly beneficial and a great boost to the country’s economy.

						<p>GST is advantageous to the Indian economy in the following ways:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>The simplified tax structure is easier to plan and administer. There is far less regulation, legislation and administration involved in the GST system.</li>

							<li>The whole country can easily do business and transport goods.</li>

							<li><a target="_blank" href="https://giddh.com/gst/">Registration under GST</a> is very easy. Compliance is easier to verify and ensure. Since every step is computerised it is extremely easy to track taxes.</li>

							<li>There will be strict control over black money as the GST tracks the supply chain through every step. If one person neglects to show taxes it will immediately show up when the next person claims input credit.</li>

							<li>No more cascading taxes.</li>

							<li>The easing of the tax burden on manufacturers will help encourage the sector. With fewer taxes, the sector will grow to manufacture at full capacity.</li>

							<li>The ease of the tax burden, when transferred to the end customer, will help reduce prices.</li>

							<li>The reduced tax burden will over time increase consumption and therefore spending also.</li>

							<li>Increased demand and supply will increase production having a beneficial effect on the economy. </li>

						<h2 class="text-uppercase"><span class="d-inline-block d-md-none">7.</span>GST is advantageous to business people in the following ways</h2>

						<h3>Unification</h3>
						
						<p>The biggest relief that the implementation of the GST has given all business people is freedom from the cascading tax regime. The earlier regime had various taxes that were levied by different authorities. Each tax had different compliance requirements. There were many tax heads that had to be calculated, collected and paid depending on the type of goods. Services were taxed differently. To add to the complications, the states levied taxes differently making doing businesses in different states rather complicated. The levies of taxes on interstate transport of goods was another time-consuming process that often saw transported goods being held up at the border check post queues. The taxes under the older regime were by different authorities making the claiming of input tax credit difficult. So, at each stage, the entire value of the goods or services were charged taxes. </p>

						<p>GST has unified the collection of taxes under one body making it very easy to claim input tax credits. So at each stage, the business person only has to bear the tax for the value addition for the goods. The interstate taxes are collected by the centre eliminating the cumbersome process of transporting goods across the state and being levied varying taxes depending on each stage. </p>

						<p>Some of the heads under which taxes were collected in the previous regime were: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Duties of Excise</li>
							<li>Central Excise Duty</li>
							<li>Additional Duties of Customs</li>
							<li>Additional Duties of Excise</li>
							<li>Special Additional Duty of Customs</li>
							<li>Central Sales Tax</li>
							<li>Cess</li>
							<li>State VAT</li>
							<li>Purchase Tax</li>
							<li>Entertainment Tax</li>
							<li>Luxury Tax</li>
							<li>Entry Tax</li>
							<li>Taxes on lotteries, betting, and gambling</li>
							<li>Taxes on advertisements</li>
						</ul>

						<p>All these taxes have been replaced by the GST scheme with a simple division of taxes as Central Goods & Service Tax (CGST) to the centre, State Goods & Services Tax (SGST) to the state and the Integrated Goods & Services Tax (IGST) for interstate business. </p>

						<h3>Example:</h3> 

						<p>If we take the example of a goods item that was manufactured and supplied to the wholesaler @ Rs. 100 attracting 10% of tax. This would amount to Rs.110. This is then supplied to a retailer after increasing the price to Rs. 150 again attracting 10% tax making it valued at Rs. 165. The retailer again adds Rs. 15 to the value making it Rs. 180 plus 10% tax making it Rs. 198. So, everybody adds their profit margin and the final buyer pays tax on the entire amount including all the taxes previously paid making it a tax on a tax. </p>

						<p>Under the GST regime, the very same goods item would be supplied to the wholesaler @ Rs. 100 attracting 10% of GST. This would amount to Rs. 110. This is then supplied to a retailer after increasing the price to Rs. 150 again attracting 10% tax making it valued at Rs. 165. But after claiming the input tax credit the actual tax burden is only on the added value of Rs. 50. The retailer again adds Rs. 15 to the value making it Rs. 180 plus 10% tax making it Rs. 198. But the actual tax borne by the retailer is only on the Rs. 15. So, even when everybody adds their profit margin they each pay the tax only for the amount that they have added and get the input tax credit for the tax that has already been paid on the incoming item. The final buyer is the person who is relieved of bearing the burden of everybody’s value addition as well as the tax on the tax paid.</p>

						<h3>Threshold and Composition Schemes</h3>							

						<p>GST has a threshold below which businesses are given certain exemptions that are aimed at encouraging startups and small businesses. Smaller businesses would find it very difficult to close books and file their taxes every month and so they have been given the benefit of being able to file every quarter thereby reducing the work involved. Under the composition scheme, the dealer does not have to worry about the supplier filing his GST to avail input tax credit. </p>

						<p>For example, if a normal taxpayer is collecting an 18% GST and then claiming input credit a composition scheme taxpayer would only be levied 2% GST but would not be claiming an input tax credit at all. So, the composition scheme taxpayer would not get his capital locked up awaiting the input tax credit payment. This makes it easier for the smaller business owner to do businesses without worrying about compliance and penalties.</p>

						<h3>Online Payments</h3>							
						
						<p>The system of paying the <a target="_blank" href="https://giddh.com/gst/">GST online</a> makes the whole system more transparent and easy for the businessperson to manage without the need for any additional help. This will eliminate the need for any middlemen or corruption at any level. It makes the entire system easy to access verify and track. Having one place to manage taxes is a huge change from the previous cascading tax system.</p>

						<h3>Easier to Comply</h3>

						<p>The earlier tax regime had many different heads and authorities that levied and collected taxes. To make matters even more complicated, the system was totally different in each state. For a person who was starting a business especially in more than one state, it would mean a whole lot of paperwork and red tape involved in taxation. It also meant that it was very difficult to comply with each and every aspect of the taxes. With the different entry taxes and interstate levies added to the tax structure, it was a very expensive and cumbersome task to run a nationwide business.</p> 

						<h3>Logistics Made Easy</h3>

						<p>The past scenarios of trucks and transport vehicles getting log jammed at interstate check posts sometimes for hours and days on end is in the past. In extreme cases, perishable goods would spoil and be unfit for sale due to the holdup. Interstate and countrywide logistics are now made simple and there is no fear of problems with paperwork and compliance differing in each state. The entire process is absolutely transparent and the whole country is now one level marketplace for business people. </p>

						<h3>Regulation and Better Coverage</h3>

						<p>With the unorganised sector being the input providers for many manufacturing industries, there is now better coverage and compliance under GST. With the ability to claim input tax credit, the entire supply chain including the unorganised sectors is getting covered under the GST scheme. This is excellent for the revenues for the government as well as for the entire financial aspect of the industries getting their taxes and books maintained properly. This helps smaller businesses maintain liquidity. </p>

						<h2 class="text-uppercase"><span class="d-inline-block d-md-none">8.</span>Understanding SGST, CGST & IGST</h2>

						<p>The division of the taxes into SGST, CGST and <a target="_blank" href="http://wbcomtax.nic.in/GST/GST_FAQ/Integrated_GST_(IGST).pdf">IGST</a> is very straightforward.</p>

						<h3>Central Goods & Service Tax (CGST)</h3>

						<p>CGST stands for the Central Goods & Service Tax (CGST).  The CGST is the levy that is paid to the central government. It is governed by the Central Goods & Services Tax Act 2016. The taxes that were levied by the centre in the former tax regime have all been replaced by this one CGST. It functions under one central authority.</p>

						<h3>State Goods & Services Tax (SGST)</h3>

						<p>SGST is the State Goods & Services Tax or SGST. It is paid to the state government and it replaces the taxes such as octroi, entry tax, state sales tax, luxury tax, etc that were collected by the state governments. All the levies that are collected under this head belong to the state government and it is controlled by the state authority that in turn is governed by the central GST body. It is this tax reform in particular that has given a big relief to business people. It was not practically achievable in the earlier regime to collect an input tax benefit when the tax on the input and the tax on the sale were levied and collected by two totally different bodies. In some cases, the tax that was collected on the input would not even exist in the state where the next sale was being made. Having the SGST of all the states under the control of one central body has made a straightforward and simple process to claim the input tax benefit without any special regard to the source and destination states. It has truly made the nation one unified level playing field for all companies and individuals.</p>

						<h3>Integrated Goods & Services Tax (IGST)</h3>

						<p>The IGST is the Integrated Goods & Services Tax is applicable to interstate supply of goods and services. It is collected by the centre and given to the respective states. It is governed by the central body. This tax has revolutionised the entire logistics and interstate scenario of the country. When the earlier regime had many interstate check posts and different taxes applied to enter each state, it resulted in bottlenecks and holding up of goods at borders. There was a lot of paperwork and the entire process was risky and time-consuming. There was no telling how long the goods would take to cross the state border. This tax has made the state borders much easier to cross and made the entire country one market.</p>

						<h3>Who should register for GST?</h3>

						<p>The implementation and functioning of the GST regime are wholly dependent on proper coverage of every person involved at every stage of the supply chain of any goods or services. Therefore, the proper coverage and <a target="_blank" href="https://giddh.com/blog/gst-and-its-impacts-on-indian-smes-working-capital/">new registration of GST</a> for all applicable businesses and individuals are very important. To register for GST, business owners can apply online. <a target="_blank" href="https://giddh.com/signup/">Registration under GST</a> is required for the following categories of people/businesses:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Any entity that was previously registered for any tax whether state or central.</li>
							<li>Businesses with a turnover that is above the threshold limit set.</li>
							<li>A casual taxable person.</li>
							<li>A non-resident taxable person</li>
							<li>Supply agents and Service Distributors</li>
							<li>Reverse Charge Taxpayers</li>
							<li>E-Commerce aggregator suppliers</li>
							<li>Provider of online database access or information retrieval to a person in India from outside India (other than a registered taxable person)</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Documents required for new GST Registration</h3>

						<p>New GST registration can be made online. The documents that are required to apply for <a target="_blank" href="https://giddh.com/gst/">GST online</a> registration are </p>

						<ul>
							<li>The PAN of the applicant</li>
							<li>The Aadhaar card of the applicant</li>
							<li>Incorporation certificate or registration proof of the business</li>
							<li>ID proof and address proof of the individual or the promoters/Directors of the business</li>
							<li>Address proof of the business</li>
							<li>Cancelled cheque or bank account statement</li>
							<li>Digital signature</li>
							<li>Board resolution or letter of authorisation to authorise the authorised signatory</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>What is GST Return?</h3>

						<p>GST returns are the tax returns that are filed through GST forms by a person with the tax authorities with details of income. These details are then used to calculate the tax liability of that person. This is a document that gives details of transactions that include:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Sales</li>
							<li>Output GST (Which is the GST charged on a sale)</li>
							<li>Purchases</li>
							<li>Input tax credit (which is the GST paid on purchases)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Therefore, the invoices that are made for purchases, as well as the sales that are filed for GST online, should be GST compliant.</p>

						<p>This has to be done every month for businesses that are not composition dealers. So, when the taxes filed every month are towards the CGST and the SGST it makes two GST returns a month and then the annual returns making it a minimum of a total of 26 GST returns per year.</p>

						<h2 class="text-uppercase"><span class="d-inline-block d-md-none">9.</span>What are the different types of GST Returns?</h2>

						<p>The different types of GST returns are categorised according to the numbers of the GST forms.</p>

						<h3>GSTR-1</h3>

						<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://gstblog.i-tax.in/Forms/Return/GSTR-1.pdf">GSTR-1 form</a> for GST returns is for the outward sale or supply of goods and services. It is to be filed every month. The last date for filing is the 11th of the subsequent month. This GST form has 13 sections. There is a special feature for businesses that have sales of up to Rs.1.5 crores who can file every quarter instead of the monthly returns that have to be filed with businesses with sales exceeding 1.5 crores. This form has to be filed even when there have been no transactions in that month. </p>

						<p>Since bulk uploads are time-consuming it is possible to upload invoices throughout the month regularly. These can be changed before the filing. This return once filed cannot be modified. Instead, it can be adjusted only during the next return. A daily late fee is charged for the CGST and the SGST from the date after the due date of the returns. The actual payment of the tax is made after the filing of the GSTR-3B.</p>

						<p>The following people are exempted from filing this return:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Composition Dealers (who will have to file GSTR-4 instead on a quarterly basis)</li>
							<li>Input Service Distributors</li>
							<li>Non-resident taxable person</li>
							<li>Taxpayer liable to collect TCS or deduct TDS</li>
							<li>Suppliers of online information and database access or retrieval services (OIDAR)</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>GSTR-2</h3>

						<p>GSTR-2 is the return that is filed listing the details of the inward taxable goods and services. It is easy to fill as it auto-populated by the details that were filled in by the seller or supplier of goods and services. It is meant to verify that the details that are given for the sale by the seller and the details given by the purchaser match each other. This is called buyer-seller reconciliation. It is necessary to be able to get the input tax credit. It should be filed by the fifteenth of the subsequent month. It is essential to file the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtel.in/Image/Form%20GSTR_2_New.pdf">GSTR-2</a> as the GSTR-3 cannot be filed without the GSTR-2 thus attracting penalties. The GSTR-2 has to be filed even when there has been no transaction in that month. The following people do not have to file GSTR-2:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Composition Dealers (who will have to file GSTR-4 instead on a quarterly basis)</li>
							<li>Input Service Distributors</li>
							<li>Non-resident taxable person</li>
							<li>Taxpayer liable to collect TCS or deduct TDS</li>
							<li>Suppliers of online information and database access or retrieval services (OIDAR)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>GST form GSTR-2 has thirteen sections to be filled.</p>

						<h3>GSTR-3</h3>

						<p>GSTR-3 is an automatically populated form of GST returns that is filled by taking the information from the GSTR-1 and the GSTR-2. It will show the actual tax liability of the person or organisation. It is due to be filed by the 20th of the month.</p>

						<h3>GSTR-3B</h3>	

						<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gst.gov.in/download/gstr3b">GSTR 3B</a> is a simple return that has the overview or summary of the details of the input tax credit as well as the outward supplies. It is a self-declared GST form. The tax liability of this form must be paid by the GST return due date of the 20th of the subsequent month. It is necessary to file this form even if there have been no transactions. The GSTR 3B form does not have to be filed by </p>

						<ul>
							<li>Non-resident taxable person</li>
							<li>Input Service Distributors & Composition Dealers</li>
							<li>Suppliers of OIDAR</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>GSTR-4</h3>

						<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://gstblog.i-tax.in/Forms/Return/GSTR-4.pdf">GSTR-4</a> is the GST returns form that is used by the composition dealer. It is filed quarterly and by the 18th of the month succeeding the quarter. When the ordinary taxpayer files three returns, one in every month of the quarter, the composition dealer files this return every 3 months. Late filing attracts a daily penalty. One cannot file the GSTR-4 for a quarter without having filed the GSTR-4 for the previous quarter. </p>

						<h3>GSTR-5</h3>

						<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtel.in/Image/Form%20GSTR_5_New.pdf">GSTR-5</a> is the return that is filed by a non-resident taxable person. This would mean a person who does not have a business in India but for a short period is making supplies in India. This return will furnish the details of these taxable supplies. A person who is making such supplies will have to obtain a special certificate of registration that is valid for the period that is specified or for 90 days, whichever is earlier. Supplies should not be made without this registration. This GST form is to be filed monthly and the GST return due date is the 20th of the next month. Late filing will attract fines and penalties. </p>

						<h3>GSTR-6</h3>

						<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtel.in/Image/Form%20GSTR_6_New.pdf">GSTR-6</a> is the GST form that is filed for an Input Service Distributor on a monthly basis. It is to be filed by the 13th of the next month. This return has details of the input tax credit that is received by the Input Service Distributor. It has 11 sections. </p>

						<h3>GSTR-6A</h3>

						<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtel.in/Image/GSTR_6A.pdf">GSTR-6A</a> is a read-only report that is automatically generated from the details that are given by suppliers in <a target="_blank" href="http://gstblog.i-tax.in/Forms/Return/GSTR-1.pdf">GSTR-1</a>. Any changes that need to be made should be done in the GSTR-6.</p>

						<h3>GSTR-7</h3>

						<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtel.in/Image/Form%20GSTR_7_New.pdf">GSTR-7</a> is the return that is filed by people and entities who deduct tax at source. It is a monthly report that has to be filed by the 10th of the next month. This return gives details of the TDS, deducted, TDS paid, TDS payable and refund of TDS if claimed. The TDS deducted can be used as the input credit and used to calculate the output tax liable. The certificate of TDS deducted is the <a target="_blank" href="http://gstblog.i-tax.in/Forms/Return/GSTR7-A.pdf">Form GSTR 7A</a> which is generated based on the GSTR-7. The details of the TDS deducted is in Part C of the <a target="_blank" href="http://smileandfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FORM-GSTR-2A.pdf">GSTR- 2A</a> which will be electronically available after the due date of the GSTR-7 filing.</p>

						<h3>GSTR-8</h3>

						<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://gstblog.i-tax.in/Forms/Return/GSTR-8.pdf">GSTR-8</a> is the GST returns to be filed by businesses and individuals transacting through eCommerce and who are required to deduct Tax collected at source (TCS). It gives the details of the supplies that have been made through eCommerce and the TCs that has been collected through the supplies. It is a monthly return that has to be filed by the 10th of the following month.</p>

						<h3>GSTR-9</h3>

						<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gst.gov.in/download/gstr9">GSTR 9</a> is the GST return that is filed by the normal taxpayer annually. Form 9 GST is to be filed by the 31st of December of the next financial year. Late filing after the GST return due date will attract a penalty. The GSTR 9 has all the details of the inward and outward supplies for the period of the entire previous financial year under all the different tax heads. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.saralaccounts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GSTR-9.pdf">Form 9 GST</a> is basically an annual return GST consolidated filing of all returns (monthly or quarterly) that were made in the year, namely the <a target="_blank" href="http://gstblog.i-tax.in/Forms/Return/GSTR-1.pdf">GSTR-1</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://smileandfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FORM-GSTR-2A.pdf">GSTR-2A</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gst.gov.in/download/gstr3b">GSTR 3B</a>.

						<h3>How do I get a GST registration?</h3>

						<h3>How to file GST return?</h3>
						<p>GST returns are to be filed online through the software or apps provided by Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN). You can file GST online at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gst.gov.in/">www.gst.gov.in</a> . </p>

						<h3>Can a person have more than one GST registration?</h3>
						<p>A person who has multiple businesses in different verticals within each state can have a different GST for each vertical within that state.</p>

						<h3>What is the composition scheme?</h3>
						<p>The GST regime has created a composition scheme to reduce the burden of taxes and the time spent computing and calculating taxes for small businesses. At present, the scheme is applicable to businesses that have a turnover that is less than Rs. 75 lakhs. They have to pay a very nominal tax of .5% or 1% of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gstcouncil.gov.in/cgst">CGST</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gstcouncil.gov.in/sgst-act">SGST</a> each. This is only applicable to sellers of goods. It is not applicable for sellers of services, eCommerce sellers, eCommerce operators and interstate sellers.</p>

						<h3>Who is ineligible for the composition scheme?	</h3>

						<p>The composition scheme does not apply to the following</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Service providers, i.e., sellers of services (exception for restaurant owners serving non-alcoholic beverages and food)
							Sellers of non-taxable goods</li>
							<li>eCommerce sellers</li>
							<li>eCommerce operators</li>
							<li>Interstate sellers</li>
							<li>Suppliers of certain goods such as ice cream, pan masala and tobacco.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>What is a bill of supply?</h3>
						<p>A person who is under the composition scheme cannot claim the tax credit and hence has to issue a bill of supply. </p>

						<h3>Can a regular registration be converted into a composition scheme registration?</h3>
						<p>A person desiring to convert from a normal registration to composition scheme would have to file an intimation in the GST form <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtel.in/Image/GST_CMP_02%20.pdf">GST CMP-2</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtel.in/Image/GST_ITC_-_3.pdf">ITC-03</a> within 60 days of the beginning of the financial year.</p>
						 
						<h3>Can a composition scheme registration be withdrawn?</h3>
						<p>Yes. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtel.in/Image/GST_CMP_04.pdf">GST CMP-04</a> form should be filled before withdrawal from the composition scheme.</p>

						<h3>Is there a format to create a GST invoice?</h3>
						<p>Yes, there is a recommended format to create a GST invoice.</p>
						
						<h3>What is an HSN code?</h3>
						<p><a target="_blank" href="http://wbcomtax.nic.in/GST/GST_FAQ/GST_HSN_CODES.pdf">HSN</a> is the Harmonized System of Nomenclature. It is a 6 digit code developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO) that is used worldwide for the classification of products. It has been in effect since 1988. </p>

						<h3>Do you need a GSTIN for the place from which the goods are originating?</h3>
						<p>Yes, the GSTIN has to be at the place where the goods are originating. However, GST is a destination-based tax. So, the tax would accrue to the place that has jurisdiction over the place of supply.</p>
						 
						<h3>Are the GSTIN & TIN numbers different?</h3>
						<p>Yes, the TIN number is registered under the VAT law and the GSTIN number under the GST law.</p>

						<h3>How will GST be applied to imports?</h3>
						<p>Imports of goods and services will be taxed as interstate supplies thereby attracting IGST based on the destination-based nature of the tax. The SGST tax will accrue to the state being supplied/consumed. </p>

						<h3>How will GST be applied to exports?</h3>
						<p>There will be no tax that will be payable on exports. Exports are treated as zero-rated supplies and the exporters can claim input tax credits. The exporter can pay the output tax and claim <a target="_blank" href="http://cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/Refund-Compendium-020719.pdf;jsessionid=8158485FB38A9E3E7916457CBFCD947A">IGST refund</a> or export without IGST and claim input tax credit refund.</p>

						<h3>What is to be done when goods are returned by the purchaser?</h3>
						<p>When goods are returned, the supplier issues a credit note to the recipient. This note will be matched with the reduction in the input tax claim. </p>
